    "# DIY Redaction Art\n",
    "\n",
    "**Redactions are a way of restricting access, of witholding information – they're dead ends. But here you can recycle redactions into something interesting, something creative, perhaps even something beautiful.**\n",
    "\n",
    "![Redaction collage example](images/redactions-bar.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The redactions used here were extracted from surveillance files created by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). The files recorded information about the activities of people who were deemed of interest to the government – due to their background, their beliefs, or perhaps just their friends. We don't know how many surveillance files have been created by ASIO over the years, but there are currently more than 7,800 files on individuals available in [series A6119](http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/scripts/AutoSearch.asp?Number=A6119) at the National Archives of Australia. Of these, 2,606 have been digitised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of these files are 'Open with exception', which means that the public versions have [pages removed and redactions applied](https://www.naa.gov.au/explore-collection/intelligence-and-security/asio-records/asio-records-exempt-information) – many, many redactions. In April 2021, I downloaded all the digitised files from A6119, comprising 280,134 page images. Using a machine learning model based on [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5), I found [404,653 redactions](https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/recordsearch/blob/master/data/A6119-redactions.csv) in the images. Of the 280,134 pages, 151,102 (54%) included redactions. The redaction finding model isn't perfect, but the number of false positives seems very small (probably less than 1 percent). I'll be sharing more information about the process shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make your own redaction art collages, just set the desired size of your final image and click on the button below. A random sample of redactions will be obtained from the dataset and packed into the image dimensions. Once it's finished you'll be able to download both the finished collage, and a CSV dataset containing metadata that describes all the redactions used, including original file references. If you're not happy with the result, try again. Every piece of redaction art is unique. Please share your creations using the #redactionart tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep a look out for an assortment of redaction art critters and doodles which I found living in the files. There should be at least one in every collage.\n",
