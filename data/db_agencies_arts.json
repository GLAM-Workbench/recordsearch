The Board consisted of four members, who were appointed to assist the Historic Memorials Committee (CA 290) in their decisions to commemorate and preserve \"for the public in oil or in stone, likenesses of prominent statesmen of Australia\". (2)   To this end, the Board, acting in an honorary capacity, advised the Committee in the matters of selecting the artists, choosing the types of memorials (i.e. paintings, sculptures etc.) and determining the payments for artists and artworks.   These duties were the primary functions of the Board, but in time it was also the Board's responsibility \"to advise the government in relation to the acquisition of works of art, exhibitions and art matters generally\". (3) The composition of the first Board was as follows: Hugh Paterson - Chairman G.V.F. Mann James Ashton D.S. Thistlethwayte   Hugh Paterson, the Chairman, was a personal friend of Andrew Fisher (later Prime Minister from 1908-1915 with short intervals) and brother of J. Ford Paterson, the artist.  Paterson himself was a successful business man in house painting and decorating and also a moderate artist.  It was Paterson who persuaded Fisher originally to do something to help Australian art and artists, resulting in the establishment of the Historic Memorials Committee in 1911 and the Art Advisory Board a year later.  Of the remaining three members, two were involved in artistic circles.  G.V.F. Mann, born in 1863, was an architect and a painter and Director of the National Art Gallery of New South Wales, when he was appointed to the Art Advisory Board.  James Ashton, born 1860, was an artist and teacher and Member of the Royal Society of Arts, as well as the Royal Drawing Society.  His son, Will Ashton became a well known artist and replaced his father as a member on the Art Advisory Board in 1918, an association that continued until 1961. (4)  Members continued to be chosen from the artistic milieu throughout the existence of the Board.  The Secretary, however, who also served as Secretary for the Historic Memorials Committee (CA 290), was a public servant, working in the Prime Minister's Department.  The first two secretaries - M.L. Shepherd (CP25) and P.E. Deane (CP78) - were both Secretaries to the Department of the Prime Minister and their primary duties were to the functioning of that Department.  The succeeding secretaries of the Board usually held public service positions at the Assistant Secretary level and were men with expertise in the cultural and welfare areas of the Prime Minister's Department.  At one stage the name of the Board changed with the addition \"Commonwealth\" to the title between (Aug.) 1958 and (Oct.) 1959.  The political changes of March 1971 and December 1972 led to administration reorganisations, which put the Board at various times under three different controlling Departments, eventually ending with the demise of the Board. Early correspondence and newspaper items in the records concerning both the Board and the Committee (held by Australian Archives) reveal that even before the formal establishment of the Art Advisory Board, advertisements were being placed in the Commonwealth Gazettes and letters written to various artists commissioning them to paint \"the pictures for the Commonwealth Gallery of Distinguished Australians\". (5)   Explicit instructions were issued to the chosen artists and those rules and regulations appeared to have been strictly adhered to. (6) In the early period of the Board's life, many Australian artists were working in Europe and it was decided to nominate a London representative, Dr Bertram Mackennal, ARA, of St John's Wood, London \"to act as the Art Advisory Board's representative in London in order to see that the commissions in the hands of such artists may be proceeded with in a satisfactory manner in terms of contract\". (7) In time the Board acquired additional responsibilities, such as the purchase of works of art, both early and modern Australian works as well as contemporary international art.  This is now housed in the Australian National Gallery in Canberra. The Board also organised and financed official Government exhibitions of Australian art overseas and contributed towards the cost of exhibitions from overseas in Australia. (8)  The Art Advisory Board came to an end on 16 February 1973, when a new policy for the arts was formulated by the Labour Government.  The Australian Council for the Arts [II] (CA 1615) came into being in February 1973, when the Labour Government announced their intention to establish the Australian Council for the Arts as a statutory authority.  This new Council was given the responsibility of preparing a report on the future shape and working arrangements for a continuing authority in the arts.  The basis of this Council was a number of boards each dealing with different areas of the arts.  Amongst the group to be established was the Visual and Plastic Arts Board  (9), also known as the Visual Arts Board, which assumed many of the functions of the Commonwealth Art Advisory Board, including advising the Historic Memorials Committee on the commissioning of portraits, but not those relating to acquisitions for the Australian National Gallery.

The Board was set up to promote, assist and co-ordinate the production, distribution and importation of films for the purpose of school and adult education; rehabilitation; social development; international understanding; trade and tourist extension and immigration.  Among the recommendations adopted by the full Cabinet were that the Board for administrative purposes should be attached to the Department of Information, and that Department would be the Commonwealth authority responsible for the production of films recommended by the Board. The Cabinet decision carried with it provision of funds for the purposes of the Board and the film work of the Department of Information.  The necessity of such a Board had been evident for many years. The Board had a domestic as well as an overseas publicity function. The technical facilities and the personnel of the Department of Information (including the Cinema Branch) were available to the board as a readily available trained nucleus.  The Board, which had been meeting very infrequently during the early 1970s, had its final meeting on 30 November 1972, the minutes being signed as a true record of the last meeting on  1 March 1973. The activities of the Board were then taken over by the Australian Film Development Corporation.

Hon. Harold Holt made a Ministerial statement in the House of Representative on Australian Cultural Activities in which he announced the establishment of an Australian Council.   He stated that \"the Council will co-operate closely with the Elizabethan Theatre Trust and with existing Commonwealth Government agencies responsible for music, painting and literature\" (Ibid): Mr Holt continued that Government financial assistance for the \"theatre Arts - drama, opera and ballet, and film-making for television with an educational and cultural emphasis\" would be channelled through the new Council for the Arts. The Council would also advise the Government on special requests for aid in cultural activities not already covered by Government agencies, and which, in the past, have been dealt with on an ad hoc basis (Ibid).   It was not however until 5 June 1968 that the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. John Gorton announced the names of the members of the Council. The Chairman was Dr. H.C Coombs, and the members Ms E. Archdale, Ms J. Bradley, W.P. Coleman MLA, Geoffrey Dutton, Ms G.D Erwin, Mr W.H. Houghton, B. Jones, Dr K. Langer and Professor K.C. Masterman (Sydney Morning Herald, 5 June 1972 p.11).  The Chairman of the Council was appointed for a period of five years and the nine members were representative of all States and the Australian Capital Territory. (Report of the Auditor-General, 1968-9, paragraph 207).   The appointment of Dr Jean Battersby as Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Council for the Arts was announced by Dr H.C. Coombs on 2 October 1968.  He said that Dr Battersby \"would be responsible to the Council for the organisation of studies of various aspects of the Arts and for the formulation for consideration by the Council, of Federal submissions to the Federal Government\".  (Sydney Morning Herald, 2 October 1968 p.2)   Commonwealth grants to the performing arts through the recommendations of the Australian Council for the Arts totalled $1,666,349 in 1968-9; $2,659,244 in 1969-70; $3,793,062 in 1970-1; $4,493,153 in 1971-2; and $5,733,643 in 1972-3. (Reports of the Auditor-General upon the Treasurer's statement of receipts and expenditure 1968-9, 1969-70, 1970-1, 1971-2, 1972-3).   The establishment of a new Council for the Arts was foreshadowed in November 1972 by the then Leader of the Opposition, E.G Whitlam when he announced the policies of the Labour Party for the arts.  He set out four broad objectives, namely to encourage excellence in the arts, to foster a wider spread of interest and participation, to help develop a national identity through artistic expression and to project Australia's image in other countries by means of the arts.  He proposed a statutory council devolving wide responsibilities on Boards for various art forms (Australian Council for the Arts, First Annual Report, January to December, 1973 p 9).   In January 1973 a new Council was established when the new Prime Minister the Rt. Hon. (E) Gough Whitlam announced a major reorganisation of Federal Government involvement in the arts.  He invited twenty-four people to form a new Council \"with a charter to ensure a continuity of support to existing recipients so that past government commitments might be honoured, to prepare a budget for the increased help which the Government had undertaken to provide and to prepare detailed plans for a Statutory Authority broadly based on the proposals outlined in the policy speech\" (Ibid).   In February 1973, the membership of the seven specialist constituent Boards was announced.  \"Approximately one third of the people appointed had been members of bodies advising the previous Government. All appointments were for one or two years. The intention was to keep things functioning while plans were developed for more lasting arrangements (Ibid). The Boards dealt respectively with Aboriginal arts, crafts, film and television, literature, music, theatre, and visual arts. Their membership varied from between eleven and fifteen people\".

The membership of the Council included four categories of people. The majority were prominent artists and persons closely involved in the arts including the Chairmen of the various Boards. They were supported by others with legal, financial and other administrative skills, with however, a known interest in the arts, and by several senior officials of government departments and agencies whose work interlocked with that of the council.   The council met for the first time on 16 February 1973 and rapidly assembled a draft report which was tabled in Parliament by the Prime Minister on 24 May 1973 on the shape and working arrangements for a continuing authority in the arts.  After considerable debate on the issues raised in the above report a final version was sent to the Prime Minister and approved by Cabinet in November 1973.

The School was set up as the national training facility for film and television professionals.  The functions of the School, as outlined in the Act, were to: provide education and training; conduct and encourage research; conduct seminars and other such courses for professionals; co-operate with other television bodies with respect to program production; offer facilities to professionals for the purposes of program production; make grants of financial assistance; and award degrees, diplomas, and certificates in relation to the educational courses offered by the school. The Act further stated that the \"School shall exercise its functions with a view to enabling and encouraging the production of films and television programs of a high degree of creativeness and of high technical and artistic standards\". (2)  Under the Act the School was to be governed by a body to be known as the Council of the Film and Television School. The Council consisted of the Director of the School, two members of the staff of the School elected by the staff, two students of the School elected by the student body, and five members appointed by the Governor-General. (3)  The first Council of the School consisted of:  Chairman: Barry Jones, MLA Members: J. Bailey          H. Crawford          J. Flaus          G. Healy          J.

Weir  The first Director of the School was Professor Jerzy Toeplitz, formerly of Poland's National Film School and the first Assistant Director was John Martin-Jones.  The School offered its first courses in 1973. Two courses were offered: the full-time program for full time students, usually not experienced in the industry, and the open program for professionals in the film and television area. The School also administered, from its first year of operation, various grants-in-aid to enable suitably qualified people to benefit from study, experience, or training in Australia or overseas. (5)  The School began its operations at 2 Help Street, Chatswood, the former offices of the Interim Council of the School. Land was acquired at North Ryde and by April 1975 the School was able to move from Chatswood and hold its courses at North Ryde.  On 29 October 1976 the Film and Television Act was amended by the insertion of the word 'Australian' before 'Film', and by the addition to the School's functions of responsibility for training and education in the areas of radio broadcasting and audio-visual communications.

This Act was assented to on 17 June 1970 and the Corporation was established by Proclamation on 17 August 1970 (Commonwealth Gazette, 17 August 1970, p 5687).   The Board of the Corporation, announced by the Prime Minister the Rt Hon John Gorton on 17 August 1970 was:  Chairman J Darling, and members D E Brown, MBE, T S Duckmanton, CBE, R S Elliott and Barry Jones. (The Australian, 18 August 1970, p 2).   By April 1974 the Corporation was providing money to the Australian film industry at an average of $130,000 per month and had been involved in the production of both feature films and films for television.  The feature films include \"Alvin Purple\", \"The Adventures of Barry McKenzie\", \"The Cars That Ate Paris\", \"Petersen\", and \"Between Wars\".   The Corporation had also helped finance the T.V documentaries 'Wild Country'- Channel 7 and 'Poisoned Dart'- Channel 10, and has provided assistance for television series including 'Ryan', 'Homicide', 'Boney', 'Silent Number', and 'Seven Little Australians'. (Department of the Media, A Review of Activities, April 1974, pp 43-47).   In a press statement on 10 December 1973, the Minister for the Media, Senator the Hon Douglas McClelland, in announcing the proposed legislation to establish an Australian Film Commission stated that the Commission would replace the Australian Film Development Corporation which would be disbanded.  (Sydney Morning Herald, 13 February 1974, p 22).   On 28 September 1974 the Australian Film Commission Bill 1974 was presented to Parliament but was rejected by the Senate on 3 December 1974. The Australian Film Commission Act was finally assented to on 7 March 1975.   However, under the terms of the Act, the Australian Film Development Corporation Act 1970 and the Australian Film Development Corporation Act (No 2) 1970, continued to be extant, as Part VI of the Act covering the repeal of these acts had to be proclaimed separately. Part VI was proclaimed on 8 July 1975 and from that date \"all rights property and assets (including the moneys standing to the credit of the Australian Film Development Fund) that immediately before [..date of proclamation..] were vested in the Australian Film Development Corporation, [were] ... vested in the Commission\". (Section 39 (2)(a) of the Australian Film Commission Act).

Cabinet agreed that an independent statutory body as recommended by the Tariff Board be established, but that the structure and membership should be a matter for further consideration between the Minister for the Media, The Treasurer and The Public Service Board. It authorised Senator McClelland to proceed with the establishment of an interim board of the Australian Film Commission so work may be commenced in the planning stages. (The Media, A collection of speeches made by the Minister for the Media, Senator The Honourable Douglas McClelland during the period 16 June - 10 December 1973, Appendix 2).

Members were Messrs. J. Darling (Chairman), R. Elliott, L. Beioley, G. Burke, H. Crawford, J. McQuaid, J. Oswin, S. Walton, R. Whitbread, Sir Keith Waller and Joan Long. The first meeting was held on 27 February 1974, and the Broadcasting and Film Division of the Department of the Media was given the responsibility of preparing more than 50 briefing papers for the Interim Board to assist its consideration of matters associated with the establishment and operation of the Australian Film Commission (Department of the Media, Report for 1 July 1973 - 30 June 1974 p. 8).  On 26 September 1974 the Australian Film Commission Bill 1974 was presented to Parliament but was rejected by the Senate on 3 December, 1974. The Bill was presented again in early 1975 and was assented to on 7 March 1975.

The functions of the Commission are to encourage and finance \"the making, promotion, distribution and exhibition of Australian Films\". It was also given powers to make, promote and exhibit film on behalf of Departments of State and in the national interest of Australia. The Act also gave the Commission the powers previously exercised by the Australian Film Development Corporation (CA 1666), although these functions were not taken over until 8 July 1975 when Part VI of the Australian Film Commission which repealed the Australian Film Development Corporation Act was proclaimed. In April 1975 considerable controversy in the Australian film industry surrounded a letter written by the then Minister for the Media Senator Douglas McClelland inviting Mr Jack Valenti, President of the Motion Picture Association of America to suggest names of people suitable for the board of the newly-formed Commission. Following the nature of this letter becoming public knowledge the Minister compiled a list of Australian nominees recommended for appointment to the Film Commission (Sydney Morning Herald 14 April 1975 p. 3) On 15 April 1975 Senator McClelland announced the membership of the Commission. Initial appointments to the Commission consisted of four full-time and four part-time members whose appointments dated from 5 May 1975: Full-time Members: Mr K. Watts - assistant general manager of the ABC (Chairman) Mr P.G. Martin Mr P.F. Condon - managing director of Paradine Pty. Ltd and Paradine-Paterson Pty.

The following Senators were appointed to serve on the Committee - Sir Magnus Cormack, Hannan, James McClelland, McManus, Milliner and Prowse.   The Committee was reconstituted on 14 March 1973 by the 28th Parliament. Its members were appointed on 28 March 1973 - Senators Carrick, Davidson, Hannan, James McClelland, Milliner and Georges.   The following matters were referred to the Committee:    - the Commonwealth's role in teacher education throughout Australia    (referred 29 April, 1971; recommendations made on 22 February,    1972);    - petitions concerning the granting of deductions from income for    taxation purposes (referred 18 August, 1971);    - all aspects of television and broadcasting, including Australian    content of television programmes (referred 19 August, 1971;    interim reports presented 25 October, 1972 and 30 August, 1973);    - education facilities for isolated children (referred 19 August,    1971).

Mr A A Tregear was Secretary of the Commission and Mr T C Pittaway was Assistant Secretary.   The Commission was to \"inquire into and report on the moving picture industry in Australia and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to inquire particularly into:   1. the importation, production, distribution and exhibition of moving    picture films;   2. the incidence and effect of the customs tariff upon the    importation of such films and the sufficiency or otherwise of    existing duties of customs;   3. the sufficiency or otherwise of the existing income tax law of the    Commonwealth in relation to persons, firms and companies engaged    in the industry; and   4. the connection with any and all of the foregoing matters, the    income, profits, expenditure and losses of such persons, firms and    companies derived from or incurred in connection with the    industry, and the amount of capital invested in the industry.\"   Evidence was taken in all the capital cities of Australia and in certain states where local problems of distribution and exhibition warranted it. 147 sittings were held and 253 witnesses were examined, evidence being taken in camera where necessary.   The four divisions of the motion picture industry were dealt with separately; namely the importation, distribution, exhibition and production of films.   The fifty recommendations of the Commission included:   . that a Board of Film Censors should be established consisting of   two men and a woman;   . that there should also be a Censorship Board of Appeal consisting   of five members, on which the motion picture industry would not be   represented;   . all film distributors in Australia should be registered and   contracts for distribution limited to 12 months;   . all motion picture exhibitors should be registered and the films   screened by them subject to the Commonwealth Censorship Board;    . the Appeal Board should issue Awards for Merit for the   encouragement of film production in Australia;   . a quota system should be introduced ensuring an increasing   percentage of Empire produced feature films, 5 in the first year   increasing to 15 in the third year;   . films shown in Mandated Territories should be passed by the   Censorship Board as suitable for that specific exhibition;   . films should be graded by the Censorship Board as \"suitable for   Universal Exhibition\" and \"For Adults Only\" with those shown at   matinees for children being only of the former type;   . educational films in the States should be assisted in every way by   the Commonwealth;   . taxation of gross earnings remitted to America by Australian Branch   companies should be reconsidered;   . British agencies should be established for the distribution of   their own films; and   . customs tariffs on British films should be continued with   reciprocal tariff preference for Australian films entering Britain   and other parts of the Empire.

Many companies were represented at this meeting and at subsequent meetings further associations, societies and bodies were represented, members of the public supplied information and gave evidence also. There were 67 sittings, 60 witnesses gave evidence and 169 exhibits were produced.   The Australasian Performing Rights Association Ltd which was incorporated on 4 January 1926 had a close association with the Performing Rights Society (Britain) in that this Society had a representative on the Board of Directors of the Australian Association, neither was profit making. In his Report the Commissioner commended the Association for its organisation and methods of distributing moneys to authors, composers, publishers and others. However, the super-monopoly of the Association in controlling over 80% of the best music which was subject to copyright meant that it controlled the music performed in public and dictated its own terms.   The Commissioner recommended that there should be a Tribunal to determine disputes arising out of the performances in public of musical works and for the use of records in public; that the Australasian Performing Rights Association should compile from time to time a list of musical works requiring licence; that there should be regular filing of accounts of the receipts and distribution of fees collected by the Australasian Performing Rights Association probably at the nearest Copyright Office; that no fees should be paid for relay broadcasting provided the initial fee had been paid and no charges made where the performance was not directly for private profit or was for religious, educational or charitable purposes.   The Report was signed on 24 April 1933, presented by Command and ordered to be printed on 24 May 1933.

(2)   The Minister of State for the Department of the Capital Territory was to be the Chairman of the Board of Governors. The City Manager (from the Department of the Capital Territory) was to be Deputy Chairman. The Board members were people of substantial standing in the fields of the arts and science.   The Festival Australia body was incorporated to organise and raise funds for a national festival of the creative arts and sciences. It was empowered 'to promote and encourage Australia arts, science and technology'(3) by organising exhibitions, festival (music, drama, films and so forth), lectures and other performances in the fields of the arts and sciences in suitable venues in Canberra. It was therefore enabled to employ persons, to engage venues and raise funds for the purpose of holding festivals.     In the Constitutions of Festival Australia sixteen objects and powers were outlined. The major objects and powers were described as:   \"(a) to promote and encourage Australian arts, science and technology and for these purpose to organise, promote manage and conduct festivals of music drama and other entertainments and exhibitions, demonstrations, expositions, lectures and other activities in Canberra or elsewhere annually or at such intervals as Festival Australia may determine;   (b) to present, produce, manage and conduct at theatres, halls galleries, cinemas, lecture theatres and other premises and open spaces activities such as operas, plays, dramas, ballets, concerts, recitals, exhibitions, readings, demonstrations, expositions, lectures, cinematographic performances and other entertainments or activities as may tend to promote and encourage Australian arts, science and technology;   (c) to engage, and employ persons and bodies corporate to produce and present such operas, plays, dramas, ballets, concerts, recitals, exhibitions, readings, demonstrations, expositions, lectures, cinematographic performances and other entertainments or activities as may tend to promote and encourage Australian arts, science and technology;   (d) to engage  employ or sponsor persons and bodies corporate to conduct or engage in research or any other activities as may tend to promote and encourage Australian arts, science or technology,   (e) to make and carry out ... arrangements... for the presentation of operas, plays, dramas, ballets, concerts, recitals, exhibitions, reading, demonstrations [etc] as may tend to promote and encourage Australian arts, science or technology..;   (f) to engage in the sale and distribution of admission tickets to entertainment or instruction conducted by or on behalf of Festival Australia;   (h) to establish such courses of study, and award such scholarships, as will enable the objects of Festival Australia to be best attained;   (i) to provide and maintain such libraries and a associated facilities as are necessary or desirable for carrying out the objects of Festival Australia;   (j) to raise money for the purpose of Festival Australia....,   (k) to invest the funds of Festival Australia or under its charge and not immediately required upon such securities or investments as the Board may from time to time determine;   (l) to undertake and execute any trusts the undertaking where or may be incidental to the attainment of the objects of Festival Australia or any of them;   (m) to establish and support and aid in the establishment and support of any associations or institutions which have for their objects the promotions, or encouragement of Australia arts, science or technology on the study of the arts, science or technology   (n) to provide meeting places, clubs and other social amenities in connection with festivals organised or promoted by Festival Australia.   (o) to acquire, hold, purchase, lease, sell, exchange, mortgage and dispose of any form of property real or personal for the purposes of Festival Australia.(4)   The original intention was that such a national festival should be held biennially, but after the first festival, Australia,'75, it was decided that this was not economically feasible.   The original Board consisted of:   Margot Anthony, Arthur Birch, John Bruce, Rupert Cater, Penelope Chapman; Michael Edgley; the Hon. Russell Fox; Lady Heydon; Ross Hohnen; L. Engledow; Arthur Kenyon; Richard Kingsland; Leonie Kramer; David Purnell.   The Secretarial staff was drawn primarily from the Department of the Capital Territory, which also provided office accommodation. The main records created by Festival Australia were the minutes of the Board's and of the Committee's meetings and correspondence, handled by the Secretariat.   By ordinance No. 34 of 1978 the Government dissolved the current Board of Governors which had last been amended by Ordinance No. 14 of 1976. Whilst ordinance No 34 did not dissolve the corporation itself, it virtually suspended the Board's activities by not making any new appointments  In future appointment would be made by instrument in writing by the Minister of State for the Capital Territory and would consist of the following:-   2 officers or employees of the Department of the Capital Territory; 1 officer or employee of the Department of the Prime Minister and      Cabinet; 1 officer or employee of the Department of Finance; 1 member of the Legislative Assembly; The Minister of State for the Capital Territory   The ordinance also stated that the rights, privileges, obligations and liabilities of the Corporation immediately before 26 October 1978 should be rested in the Commonwealth, and that the Commonwealth should also be substituted for the Corporation in any legal proceedings.(5)   As this ordinance only suspended the activities of the Board and did not abolish the organisation itself, the closing date of the date range of this agency had been taken as 1979, the year in which Festival Australia Inc. is no longer listed in the Commonwealth Directory as an organisation for which the Minister for the Capital Territory is responsible.   This information was drawn primarily from the Australian Government Directory. 1974 and  1979; from the Festival Australia Incorporation Ordinance 1973, from the records created by Festival Australia; and from Mr W.E Lawrence, present member of the Board of Governors.

The Ordinance was gazetted on 21 June 1965 (1) and trustees were appointed on 22 June. (2) Under Section 4(2) of the Ordinance the Trust was established as a body corporate, with a common seal, the ability to acquire, hold and dispose of real and personal property and the ability to sue or be sued in its corporate name. Under Section 4(3) of the ordinance all courts, judges and persons acting judicially were required to take judicial notice of the common seal of the trust affixed to a document and to assume that it was duly affixed. Under Section 17 of the Ordinance, the functions of the Trust were stated as being: a) to occupy the Canberra Theatre Centre, and to use and manage it as a concert hall, theatre and place of assembly for the presentation of artistic and cultural entertainments displays and exhibitions and other forms of entertainment and instruction; b) to promote and encourage the development and presentation of the arts; c) to promote and encourage public interest and participation in, and appreciation of, the arts; c) to the extent that the Canberra Theatre Centre is not required for the purposes of the performance of the foregoing functions, to make it available for public and other meetings, and for conventions, receptions and other gatherings. Under Section 18(1) of the Ordinance the Trust was empowered to do all things necessary or convenient to be done in connection with, or as incidental to, the performance of its functions. Section 18 (2a-2f) details particular powers of the Trust in relation to contracts, purchase, granting of rights to use the Theatre, admission charges, recording and broadcasting and provision of public facilities (restaurant etc). Under Section 30 of the Ordinance, the Trust was required to furnish the Minister such information relating to its operations as the Minister from time to time requires. Under Section 32 (1) of the Ordinance, the trust was required, as soon as practicable after each thirteenth day of June, to furnish to the Minister a report of its operations during the year ended on that date, together with financial statements, in such form as the Minister of State for finance approves, in respect of that year. Under Section 6 and Section 7 of the Ordinance the Trust was to be constituted by a Chairman, a Deputy Chairman and seven other trustees. All trustees were to be appointed by the Minister for the Interior [II] (and later for the Capital Territory). Six trustees constituted a quorum, voting being decided by a majority of votes. The first trustees were: Leslie Bruce Hamilton, Stefan Haag, John Casson, Ian Maclean, Hector William Crawford, Clement William Semmler, Arthur Thomas Shakespeare, George Alexander Currie and Richard Kingsland. These were appointed for a period of one year, however, Section 6(2) of the Ordinance states that the Minister may appoint trustees for a period not exceeding five years.

Therefore on 3 September 1976 the Australian Art Exhibitions Corporation (AAEC) Limited was established as a company owned by the Australia Council. The AAEC, together with another organisation, the Australian GalleryDirector's Council, successfully managed several exhibitions including the El Dorado-Colombian Gold Exhibition (in 1978) and the Pompeii Exhibition (in 1980). Both agencies however, experienced financial difficulties and ultimately went into liquidation. In 1979 the Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon R.J. Ellicott, initiated the first moves towards establishing a Commonwealth organisation which would specialise in international exhibitions. On 16 May 1980 the first board of Directors of the International Cultural Corporation of Australia (ICCA) was appointed and held the inaugural meeting. The agency however, was formally incorporated on 24 June 1980. It was a Commonwealth-owned company registered in the Australian Capital Territory. The major aim of the Corporation is to bring to Australia significant international exhibitions and displays of art, antiquities and other items of artistic, cultural and historical interest. It also aims to send overseas the best of Australian art, antiquities and related items. The Corporation is entrepreneurial in its methods of operation and seeks sponsorship from the private sector. It offers its expertise and assistance to the Federal and State Governments and to museums and galleries. For the first four years of operation ICCA received a grant of $250,000 from the Australian Government. The agency's title changed to Art Exhibitions Australia Limited in March 1991. The charter of the company is to manage exhibitions and displays of art, antiquities and other cultural or historical material. The company functions as a self-funding, non-profit body governed by a Board of Directors who serve in an honorary capacity. The initial Chairman of the company was Mr James Leslie, Chairman and Managing Director of Mobil Oil Australia Ltd and the Board comprised as follows: Mr Norman Baker, Arthur Young and Co (Deputy Chairman) Dr Jean Battersby, CEO, Australia Council Mr Franco Belgiorno-Nettis, Managing Director, Transfield Group Mr Edmund Capon, Director, Art Gallery of NSW Ms Betty Churcher, Director, Australian National Gallery Mr Michael Darling, Managing Director, Clayton Robard Ltd Mr Robert Edwards, Director, Museum of Victoria (Chief Executive) Mrs Ann Lewis, Co-publisher of Xpress magazine Hon. Mr Justice John Lockhart, Judge of the Federal Court Mr Alan McGregor, grazier Mr Robert S. McKay Since its inception the following exhibitions have been arranged and managed by the Corporation: Aboriginal Art, Australian Pictorial Photography, Chinese Paintings of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, Fabulous Fashions 1907-1967, Australian Exhibition, Modern Commonwealth, Australian Heritage, Chinese Landscape Photography, Japan - Masterpieces from the Idemitsu Collection, Kandinsky Exhibition, Leonardo da Vinci Anatomical Drawings, Commonwealth Arts Festival; and Xian Exhibition, Terracotta Figures, China Records created by the Corporation include correspondence, financial documentation, newspaper clippings, catalogues, videocassettes and photographs. Exhibitions managed by ICCA (up to March 1991) were indemnified by the Commonwealth. The succeeding company, Art Exhibitions Australia Limited, was entered on the Register of Cultural Organisations established under Section 78(1)(a) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, listing bodies eligible to receive tax deductible donations. The company maintains close links with the Commonwealth arts portfolio and continues to receive indemnity on exhibitions.

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 provides the Corporation with a seal, a Board of Directors, a Managing Director, an Advisory Council and State, Territory and regional Advisory Councils. In addition, the Board may establish advisory committees. According to press coverage and advertisements in July 1983, the Corporation was setting up a Secretariat group in Sydney in line with recommendations of the Dix Committee. The Secretariat was to research and develop policy options for the Board. The Corporation's functions include the provision of innovative and comprehensive broadcasting and television services of a high standard that involve broadcasting and television programs of an educational nature and that contribute to a sense of national identity, inform and entertain, and reflect the cultural diversity of the Australian Community. The Corporation's functions also include the transmission to countries outside Australia, of broadcasting and television programs of news, current affairs, entertainment and cultural enrichment; and the encouragement and promotion of the musical, dramatic and other performing arts in Australia. As part of its administration of these functions the ABC has an extensive network of television and radio broadcasting stations throughout Australia. The Corporation has Branch Offices in the State capitals, with Regional Offices in major regional centres. The ABC also has representation overseas and encompasses the operations of Radio Australia. The Corporation has power to do all things necessary or convenient to be done for, or in connection with, the performance of its functions and, in particular, to enter into contracts and to acquire, hold and dispose of real or personal property.

Items from Artbank's collection are available on lease for display in Commonwealth Government offices and other agencies in Australia and overseas. Clients are encouraged to place these works wherever large numbers of people meet, eg reception areas, foyers, etc. In this way they are enabling more Australians to become familiar with the works of their contemporaries.   Artbank's Acquisitions Advisory Committee chooses works of art from items submitted by the Director. These works can then be leased for an annual rental fee of 12% of their current market value. This Committee meets regularly in State capital cities. As at 1980 it was intended to establish Selection Advisory Panels in the States.    The first Director of Artbank was Mr Graeme Sturgeon. The first Board of Artbank was Mr Richard Crebbin, Ms Sue Walker, Mr Kenneth Jack and Mr Carl Andrew.   On 27 December 1991 Artbank was transferred to the responsibility of the Minister for the newly created Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Executive Council Minute No. 12, Commonwealth of Australia Gazette No. S 370, Friday, 27 December 1991).

This Act changed the functions of the School, as originally established, by giving it responsibility for training in the areas of radio broadcasting and audio-visual communications. The name of the School was changed to Australian Film, Television and Radio School by the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, to properly reflect the functions of the school.  It retained its previous functions of education and training in film and television for both students and professionals, and the administration of financial grants. (1)  As part of the change in function the School established a Radio Unit which, in 1979, began by providing services and training to Aboriginal broadcasters. In 1981 the School installed a broadcast standard studio and began training for all sectors of radio broadcasting. At this time it also began a course in commercial radio techniques. (2)  Professor Jerzy Toeplitz who had been appointed director of the original Film and Television School (CA 1617) was replaced in 1980 by A.S. Walton. (3)  In 1985 (9 May) Walton was replaced by Ms Anne Deveson. (4)  The new Director instituted an examination of the School's activities which resulted in a report entitled \"New Directions Review\".  This review found gaps in the School's performance and recommended that the School: place greater emphasis on television training; increase training for aboriginals in the film, video, and television areas; increase the involvement of the School with industry; increase training in entrepreneurial skills; monitor technological developments in the industry; and introduced a new program to enable professionals to experiment. The main aim of the change in direction was to make the School more relevant to the professional needs of the industry and to reduce costs by increasing cooperation with other organisations. (5) The Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1986 changed the name of the School to the Australian Film, Television and Radio School.  In June 1986 work commenced on the School's first permanent home, a site within the grounds of Macquarie University, North Ryde.

From 23 October 1990 to 1 January 1992, the Institute was funded jointly by the Commonwealth and Australian Capital Territory  Government's.   In July 1989, an affiliation agreement was made between the Institute and the Australian National University (ANU).  As a result of this, discussions took place on the feasibility of amalgamation from the beginning of 1991.   The new arrangement was designed to achieve autonomy for the Institute, while giving students academic and administrative benefits by being aligned to a larger institution.  It would also preserve the relationship between the Institute and the Canberra community.   The amending legislation for the amalgamation was not ready by 1 January 1991.  Instead, amendments to the existing Australian National University Act were assented to by Parliament on 2 September 1991 and confirmed the establishment of an institute previously known as the Canberra Institute of the Arts within the University to take effect from 1 January 1992.    The Institute would be known as the Institute of the Arts and included the Canberra School of Music and the Canberra School of Art.   The amended Australian National University Act 1991, No. 131 of 1991, also repealed the Canberra Institute of the Arts Ordinance 1988.   The internal structure of the newly established Institute of the Arts remained as before except that it was now governed by a Board responsible to the Council of the University.   The University was given the power to employ staff, enrol students and grant a degree, diploma or certificate of the Institute of the Arts. The assets and liabilities of the Institute also became those of the University.

Sources Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 60th Anniversary 1932-1992 Supplement to 24 Hours July, 1992 Directory  From the time of establishment of the Australian Broadcasting Commission (now Corporation) in 1932 orchestral music has been an important part of ABC music and concert presentation.  A National Broadcasting Symphony Orchestra participated in the opening night ABC program on July 1, 1932.  There was early intention by ABC management to set up a symphony orchestra in each State.  First use of the name Melbourne Symphony Orchestra was in 1906, this orchestra was founded by Alberto Zelman, junior.  During the period 1932 - 36 orchestras performing for an ABC concert were announced as, \"appearing under the auspices of\", \"in association with\", or by courtesy of\" the University of Melbourne.  This was in recognition of the fact that the University 'owned' the name but was prepared to allow the ABC to take over administrative control of the orchestra and use the name ABC (Melbourne) Symphony Orchestra.  The first year of a permanent ABC orchestra in Victoria was 1949.  This orchestra was called the Victorian Symphony Orchestra at the insistence of the Victorian Government.    It was not until 1965 when the name reverted to Melbourne Symphony Orchestra under the then Premier Sir Henry Bolte.  By 1957 the last of the State Symphony Orchestras had been set up.  Development of the ABC's six symphony orchestras has taken 25 years from the modest beginnings [1932].  The ABC was by then possibly the largest single comprehensive concert giving organisation in the world.

Under the Tasmanian Orchestra Agreement Act of 1948, the Tasmanian Government was authorised to enter into an agreement with the ABC for the establishment of an orchestra to be known as the Tasmanian Orchestra.  The agreement provided that the ABC establish the Tasmanian Orchestra as from March 1948.  During 1972 it was decided that it would be known in future as the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra (TSO) on all occasions.  The TSO is the smallest of the six ABC orchestras.  It entrepreneurs its own subscription series of concerts in Hobart and Launceston, tours Tasmanian regional centres, plays for visiting ballet companies, performs free outdoor concerts, has a comprehensive education program, and has received wide exposure via recordings, national broadcasts and television appearances.  The ABC is responsible for the management and control of the orchestra and also provides funding for a bulk of the operational costs with further funding provided from the Tasmanian Government, local councils and corporate sponsorship.  In 1985 the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Concert Music Department was formed incorporating the TSO.  As a result the TSO was given greater autonomy of management to be more responsible to local needs.

The Board consisted of four members, who were appointed to assist the Historic Memorials Committee (CA 290) in their decisions to commemorate and preserve \"for the public in oil or in stone, likenesses of prominent statesmen of Australia\". (2)   To this end, the Board, acting in an honorary capacity, advised the Committee in the matters of selecting the artists, choosing the types of memorials (i.e. paintings, sculptures etc.) and determining the payments for artists and artworks.   These duties were the primary functions of the Board, but in time it was also the Board's responsibility \"to advise the government in relation to the acquisition of works of art, exhibitions and art matters generally\". (3) The composition of the first Board was as follows: Hugh Paterson - Chairman G.V.F. Mann James Ashton D.S. Thistlethwayte   Hugh Paterson, the Chairman, was a personal friend of Andrew Fisher (later Prime Minister from 1908-1915 with short intervals) and brother of J. Ford Paterson, the artist.  Paterson himself was a successful business man in house painting and decorating and also a moderate artist.  It was Paterson who persuaded Fisher originally to do something to help Australian art and artists, resulting in the establishment of the Historic Memorials Committee in 1911 and the Art Advisory Board a year later.  Of the remaining three members, two were involved in artistic circles.  G.V.F. Mann, born in 1863, was an architect and a painter and Director of the National Art Gallery of New South Wales, when he was appointed to the Art Advisory Board.  James Ashton, born 1860, was an artist and teacher and Member of the Royal Society of Arts, as well as the Royal Drawing Society.  His son, Will Ashton became a well known artist and replaced his father as a member on the Art Advisory Board in 1918, an association that continued until 1961. (4)  Members continued to be chosen from the artistic milieu throughout the existence of the Board.  The Secretary, however, who also served as Secretary for the Historic Memorials Committee (CA 290), was a public servant, working in the Prime Minister's Department.  The first two secretaries - M.L. Shepherd (CP25) and P.E. Deane (CP78) - were both Secretaries to the Department of the Prime Minister and their primary duties were to the functioning of that Department.  The succeeding secretaries of the Board usually held public service positions at the Assistant Secretary level and were men with expertise in the cultural and welfare areas of the Prime Minister's Department.  At one stage the name of the Board changed with the addition \"Commonwealth\" to the title between (Aug.) 1958 and (Oct.) 1959.  The political changes of March 1971 and December 1972 led to administration reorganisations, which put the Board at various times under three different controlling Departments, eventually ending with the demise of the Board. Early correspondence and newspaper items in the records concerning both the Board and the Committee (held by Australian Archives) reveal that even before the formal establishment of the Art Advisory Board, advertisements were being placed in the Commonwealth Gazettes and letters written to various artists commissioning them to paint \"the pictures for the Commonwealth Gallery of Distinguished Australians\". (5)   Explicit instructions were issued to the chosen artists and those rules and regulations appeared to have been strictly adhered to. (6) In the early period of the Board's life, many Australian artists were working in Europe and it was decided to nominate a London representative, Dr Bertram Mackennal, ARA, of St John's Wood, London \"to act as the Art Advisory Board's representative in London in order to see that the commissions in the hands of such artists may be proceeded with in a satisfactory manner in terms of contract\". (7) In time the Board acquired additional responsibilities, such as the purchase of works of art, both early and modern Australian works as well as contemporary international art.  This is now housed in the Australian National Gallery in Canberra. The Board also organised and financed official Government exhibitions of Australian art overseas and contributed towards the cost of exhibitions from overseas in Australia. (8)  The Art Advisory Board came to an end on 16 February 1973, when a new policy for the arts was formulated by the Labour Government.  The Australian Council for the Arts [II] (CA 1615) came into being in February 1973, when the Labour Government announced their intention to establish the Australian Council for the Arts as a statutory authority.  This new Council was given the responsibility of preparing a report on the future shape and working arrangements for a continuing authority in the arts.  The basis of this Council was a number of boards each dealing with different areas of the arts.  Amongst the group to be established was the Visual and Plastic Arts Board  (9), also known as the Visual Arts Board, which assumed many of the functions of the Commonwealth Art Advisory Board, including advising the Historic Memorials Committee on the commissioning of portraits, but not those relating to acquisitions for the Australian National Gallery.

The Board was set up to promote, assist and co-ordinate the production, distribution and importation of films for the purpose of school and adult education; rehabilitation; social development; international understanding; trade and tourist extension and immigration.  Among the recommendations adopted by the full Cabinet were that the Board for administrative purposes should be attached to the Department of Information, and that Department would be the Commonwealth authority responsible for the production of films recommended by the Board. The Cabinet decision carried with it provision of funds for the purposes of the Board and the film work of the Department of Information.  The necessity of such a Board had been evident for many years. The Board had a domestic as well as an overseas publicity function. The technical facilities and the personnel of the Department of Information (including the Cinema Branch) were available to the board as a readily available trained nucleus.  The Board, which had been meeting very infrequently during the early 1970s, had its final meeting on 30 November 1972, the minutes being signed as a true record of the last meeting on  1 March 1973. The activities of the Board were then taken over by the Australian Film Development Corporation.

Hon. Harold Holt made a Ministerial statement in the House of Representative on Australian Cultural Activities in which he announced the establishment of an Australian Council.   He stated that \"the Council will co-operate closely with the Elizabethan Theatre Trust and with existing Commonwealth Government agencies responsible for music, painting and literature\" (Ibid): Mr Holt continued that Government financial assistance for the \"theatre Arts - drama, opera and ballet, and film-making for television with an educational and cultural emphasis\" would be channelled through the new Council for the Arts. The Council would also advise the Government on special requests for aid in cultural activities not already covered by Government agencies, and which, in the past, have been dealt with on an ad hoc basis (Ibid).   It was not however until 5 June 1968 that the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. John Gorton announced the names of the members of the Council. The Chairman was Dr. H.C Coombs, and the members Ms E. Archdale, Ms J. Bradley, W.P. Coleman MLA, Geoffrey Dutton, Ms G.D Erwin, Mr W.H. Houghton, B. Jones, Dr K. Langer and Professor K.C. Masterman (Sydney Morning Herald, 5 June 1972 p.11).  The Chairman of the Council was appointed for a period of five years and the nine members were representative of all States and the Australian Capital Territory. (Report of the Auditor-General, 1968-9, paragraph 207).   The appointment of Dr Jean Battersby as Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Council for the Arts was announced by Dr H.C. Coombs on 2 October 1968.  He said that Dr Battersby \"would be responsible to the Council for the organisation of studies of various aspects of the Arts and for the formulation for consideration by the Council, of Federal submissions to the Federal Government\".  (Sydney Morning Herald, 2 October 1968 p.2)   Commonwealth grants to the performing arts through the recommendations of the Australian Council for the Arts totalled $1,666,349 in 1968-9; $2,659,244 in 1969-70; $3,793,062 in 1970-1; $4,493,153 in 1971-2; and $5,733,643 in 1972-3. (Reports of the Auditor-General upon the Treasurer's statement of receipts and expenditure 1968-9, 1969-70, 1970-1, 1971-2, 1972-3).   The establishment of a new Council for the Arts was foreshadowed in November 1972 by the then Leader of the Opposition, E.G Whitlam when he announced the policies of the Labour Party for the arts.  He set out four broad objectives, namely to encourage excellence in the arts, to foster a wider spread of interest and participation, to help develop a national identity through artistic expression and to project Australia's image in other countries by means of the arts.  He proposed a statutory council devolving wide responsibilities on Boards for various art forms (Australian Council for the Arts, First Annual Report, January to December, 1973 p 9).   In January 1973 a new Council was established when the new Prime Minister the Rt. Hon. (E) Gough Whitlam announced a major reorganisation of Federal Government involvement in the arts.  He invited twenty-four people to form a new Council \"with a charter to ensure a continuity of support to existing recipients so that past government commitments might be honoured, to prepare a budget for the increased help which the Government had undertaken to provide and to prepare detailed plans for a Statutory Authority broadly based on the proposals outlined in the policy speech\" (Ibid).   In February 1973, the membership of the seven specialist constituent Boards was announced.  \"Approximately one third of the people appointed had been members of bodies advising the previous Government. All appointments were for one or two years. The intention was to keep things functioning while plans were developed for more lasting arrangements (Ibid). The Boards dealt respectively with Aboriginal arts, crafts, film and television, literature, music, theatre, and visual arts. Their membership varied from between eleven and fifteen people\".

The speech also proposed a statutory Council involving wide responsibilities on Boards for various art forms.

The membership of the Council included four categories of people. The majority were prominent artists and persons closely involved in the arts including the Chairmen of the various Boards. They were supported by others with legal, financial and other administrative skills, with however, a known interest in the arts, and by several senior officials of government departments and agencies whose work interlocked with that of the council.   The council met for the first time on 16 February 1973 and rapidly assembled a draft report which was tabled in Parliament by the Prime Minister on 24 May 1973 on the shape and working arrangements for a continuing authority in the arts.  After considerable debate on the issues raised in the above report a final version was sent to the Prime Minister and approved by Cabinet in November 1973.

The School was set up as the national training facility for film and television professionals.  The functions of the School, as outlined in the Act, were to: provide education and training; conduct and encourage research; conduct seminars and other such courses for professionals; co-operate with other television bodies with respect to program production; offer facilities to professionals for the purposes of program production; make grants of financial assistance; and award degrees, diplomas, and certificates in relation to the educational courses offered by the school. The Act further stated that the \"School shall exercise its functions with a view to enabling and encouraging the production of films and television programs of a high degree of creativeness and of high technical and artistic standards\". (2)  Under the Act the School was to be governed by a body to be known as the Council of the Film and Television School. The Council consisted of the Director of the School, two members of the staff of the School elected by the staff, two students of the School elected by the student body, and five members appointed by the Governor-General. (3)  The first Council of the School consisted of:  Chairman: Barry Jones, MLA Members: J. Bailey          H. Crawford          J. Flaus          G. Healy          J. Long (Deputy Chairman)          R.K. Mason          J.H.M. Oswin          B. Robinson          P. Weir  The first Director of the School was Professor Jerzy Toeplitz, formerly of Poland's National Film School and the first Assistant Director was John Martin-Jones.  The School offered its first courses in 1973. Two courses were offered: the full-time program for full time students, usually not experienced in the industry, and the open program for professionals in the film and television area. The School also administered, from its first year of operation, various grants-in-aid to enable suitably qualified people to benefit from study, experience, or training in Australia or overseas. (5)  The School began its operations at 2 Help Street, Chatswood, the former offices of the Interim Council of the School. Land was acquired at North Ryde and by April 1975 the School was able to move from Chatswood and hold its courses at North Ryde.  On 29 October 1976 the Film and Television Act was amended by the insertion of the word 'Australian' before 'Film', and by the addition to the School's functions of responsibility for training and education in the areas of radio broadcasting and audio-visual communications.

Under Section 21 part 1 the Corporation has power:   (a) to make loans on such terms and conditions, including conditions     as to repayments of principal and payment of interest, as the     Corporation thinks fit, to producers of Australian films;    (b) to guarantee -       (i) the due repayment of loans made to producers of Australian           films; and      (ii) the due payment of interest on such loans.   (c) to provide financial assistance to producers of Australian films     under arrangements that entitle the Corporation to receive a     share of the proceeds derived from the sale, hire or exhibition     of the films or, the inclusion of the films in television     programmes but do not render the Corporation liable for any debts     incurred by those producers; and   (d) subject to the approval of the Minister, to form, or participate     with another person in the formation of a company for the purpose     of carrying on business, of the distribution of Australian films     and to acquire, hold and dispose of shares or stock in the     capital of a company carrying on such a business.   By Section 18 one million dollars was appropriated for the Corporation.   Under Section 6 the Corporation was to consist of a Chairman and four other members appointed by the Governor-General, and under Section 22 there was also to be an Executive Officer to manage the affairs of the Corporation.   This Act was assented to on 17 June 1970 and the Corporation was established by Proclamation on 17 August 1970 (Commonwealth Gazette, 17 August 1970, p 5687).   The Board of the Corporation, announced by the Prime Minister the Rt Hon John Gorton on 17 August 1970 was:  Chairman J Darling, and members D E Brown, MBE, T S Duckmanton, CBE, R S Elliott and Barry Jones. (The Australian, 18 August 1970, p 2).   By April 1974 the Corporation was providing money to the Australian film industry at an average of $130,000 per month and had been involved in the production of both feature films and films for television.  The feature films include \"Alvin Purple\", \"The Adventures of Barry McKenzie\", \"The Cars That Ate Paris\", \"Petersen\", and \"Between Wars\".   The Corporation had also helped finance the T.V documentaries 'Wild Country'- Channel 7 and 'Poisoned Dart'- Channel 10, and has provided assistance for television series including 'Ryan', 'Homicide', 'Boney', 'Silent Number', and 'Seven Little Australians'. (Department of the Media, A Review of Activities, April 1974, pp 43-47).   In a press statement on 10 December 1973, the Minister for the Media, Senator the Hon Douglas McClelland, in announcing the proposed legislation to establish an Australian Film Commission stated that the Commission would replace the Australian Film Development Corporation which would be disbanded.  (Sydney Morning Herald, 13 February 1974, p 22).   On 28 September 1974 the Australian Film Commission Bill 1974 was presented to Parliament but was rejected by the Senate on 3 December 1974. The Australian Film Commission Act was finally assented to on 7 March 1975.   However, under the terms of the Act, the Australian Film Development Corporation Act 1970 and the Australian Film Development Corporation Act (No 2) 1970, continued to be extant, as Part VI of the Act covering the repeal of these acts had to be proclaimed separately. Part VI was proclaimed on 8 July 1975 and from that date \"all rights property and assets (including the moneys standing to the credit of the Australian Film Development Fund) that immediately before [..date of proclamation..] were vested in the Australian Film Development Corporation, [were] ... vested in the Commission\".

Cabinet agreed that an independent statutory body as recommended by the Tariff Board be established, but that the structure and membership should be a matter for further consideration between the Minister for the Media, The Treasurer and The Public Service Board. It authorised Senator McClelland to proceed with the establishment of an interim board of the Australian Film Commission so work may be commenced in the planning stages. (The Media, A collection of speeches made by the Minister for the Media, Senator The Honourable Douglas McClelland during the period 16 June - 10 December 1973, Appendix 2).

Mr A A Tregear was Secretary of the Commission and Mr T C Pittaway was Assistant Secretary.   The Commission was to \"inquire into and report on the moving picture industry in Australia and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to inquire particularly into:   1. the importation, production, distribution and exhibition of moving    picture films;   2. the incidence and effect of the customs tariff upon the    importation of such films and the sufficiency or otherwise of    existing duties of customs;   3. the sufficiency or otherwise of the existing income tax law of the    Commonwealth in relation to persons, firms and companies engaged    in the industry; and   4. the connection with any and all of the foregoing matters, the    income, profits, expenditure and losses of such persons, firms and    companies derived from or incurred in connection with the    industry, and the amount of capital invested in the industry.\"   Evidence was taken in all the capital cities of Australia and in certain states where local problems of distribution and exhibition warranted it. 147 sittings were held and 253 witnesses were examined, evidence being taken in camera where necessary.   The four divisions of the motion picture industry were dealt with separately; namely the importation, distribution, exhibition and production of films.   The fifty recommendations of the Commission included:   . that a Board of Film Censors should be established consisting of   two men and a woman;   . that there should also be a Censorship Board of Appeal consisting   of five members, on which the motion picture industry would not be   represented;   . all film distributors in Australia should be registered and   contracts for distribution limited to 12 months;   . all motion picture exhibitors should be registered and the films   screened by them subject to the Commonwealth Censorship Board;    . the Appeal Board should issue Awards for Merit for the   encouragement of film production in Australia;   . a quota system should be introduced ensuring an increasing   percentage of Empire produced feature films, 5 in the first year   increasing to 15 in the third year;   . films shown in Mandated Territories should be passed by the   Censorship Board as suitable for that specific exhibition;   . films should be graded by the Censorship Board as \"suitable for   Universal Exhibition\" and \"For Adults Only\" with those shown at   matinees for children being only of the former type;   . educational films in the States should be assisted in every way by   the Commonwealth;   . taxation of gross earnings remitted to America by Australian Branch   companies should be reconsidered;   .

The first meeting was held in Sydney on 23 September 1932 and J H Keating appeared as Counsel to assist the Commission and represent the public. Many companies were represented at this meeting and at subsequent meetings further associations, societies and bodies were represented, members of the public supplied information and gave evidence also. There were 67 sittings, 60 witnesses gave evidence and 169 exhibits were produced.   The Australasian Performing Rights Association Ltd which was incorporated on 4 January 1926 had a close association with the Performing Rights Society (Britain) in that this Society had a representative on the Board of Directors of the Australian Association, neither was profit making. In his Report the Commissioner commended the Association for its organisation and methods of distributing moneys to authors, composers, publishers and others. However, the super-monopoly of the Association in controlling over 80% of the best music which was subject to copyright meant that it controlled the music performed in public and dictated its own terms.   The Commissioner recommended that there should be a Tribunal to determine disputes arising out of the performances in public of musical works and for the use of records in public; that the Australasian Performing Rights Association should compile from time to time a list of musical works requiring licence; that there should be regular filing of accounts of the receipts and distribution of fees collected by the Australasian Performing Rights Association probably at the nearest Copyright Office; that no fees should be paid for relay broadcasting provided the initial fee had been paid and no charges made where the performance was not directly for private profit or was for religious, educational or charitable purposes.

The idea of such festival held in Canberra had been mooted as early as 1968 by the Canberra Theatre Trust. A group of people were brought together within the Department of the Capital Territory to make preparations for the Festival planed for March 1975. The Ordinance governing the Activities of Festival Australia was drawn up in the Department of the Capital Territory, and by the Ordinance the Board of Governors was appointed.(1)  A number of committees were also set up by the Ordinance Schedule. They were:   Programme - Arts Committee, Programme - Science Committee, Finance Committee, Public Relations Committee, Community Participation Committee. (2)   The Minister of State for the Department of the Capital Territory was to be the Chairman of the Board of Governors. The City Manager (from the Department of the Capital Territory) was to be Deputy Chairman. The Board members were people of substantial standing in the fields of the arts and science.   The Festival Australia body was incorporated to organise and raise funds for a national festival of the creative arts and sciences. It was empowered 'to promote and encourage Australia arts, science and technology'(3) by organising exhibitions, festival (music, drama, films and so forth), lectures and other performances in the fields of the arts and sciences in suitable venues in Canberra. It was therefore enabled to employ persons, to engage venues and raise funds for the purpose of holding festivals.     In the Constitutions of Festival Australia sixteen objects and powers were outlined. The major objects and powers were described as:   \"(a) to promote and encourage Australian arts, science and technology and for these purpose to organise, promote manage and conduct festivals of music drama and other entertainments and exhibitions, demonstrations, expositions, lectures and other activities in Canberra or elsewhere annually or at such intervals as Festival Australia may determine;   (b) to present, produce, manage and conduct at theatres, halls galleries, cinemas, lecture theatres and other premises and open spaces activities such as operas, plays, dramas, ballets, concerts, recitals, exhibitions, readings, demonstrations, expositions, lectures, cinematographic performances and other entertainments or activities as may tend to promote and encourage Australian arts, science and technology;   (c) to engage, and employ persons and bodies corporate to produce and present such operas, plays, dramas, ballets, concerts, recitals, exhibitions, readings, demonstrations, expositions, lectures, cinematographic performances and other entertainments or activities as may tend to promote and encourage Australian arts, science and technology;   (d) to engage  employ or sponsor persons and bodies corporate to conduct or engage in research or any other activities as may tend to promote and encourage Australian arts, science or technology,   (e) to make and carry out ... arrangements... for the presentation of operas, plays, dramas, ballets, concerts, recitals, exhibitions, reading, demonstrations [etc] as may tend to promote and encourage Australian arts, science or technology..;   (f) to engage in the sale and distribution of admission tickets to entertainment or instruction conducted by or on behalf of Festival Australia;   (h) to establish such courses of study, and award such scholarships, as will enable the objects of Festival Australia to be best attained;   (i) to provide and maintain such libraries and a associated facilities as are necessary or desirable for carrying out the objects of Festival Australia;   (j) to raise money for the purpose of Festival Australia....,   (k) to invest the funds of Festival Australia or under its charge and not immediately required upon such securities or investments as the Board may from time to time determine;   (l) to undertake and execute any trusts the undertaking where or may be incidental to the attainment of the objects of Festival Australia or any of them;   (m) to establish and support and aid in the establishment and support of any associations or institutions which have for their objects the promotions, or encouragement of Australia arts, science or technology on the study of the arts, science or technology   (n) to provide meeting places, clubs and other social amenities in connection with festivals organised or promoted by Festival Australia.   (o) to acquire, hold, purchase, lease, sell, exchange, mortgage and dispose of any form of property real or personal for the purposes of Festival Australia.(4)   The original intention was that such a national festival should be held biennially, but after the first festival, Australia,'75, it was decided that this was not economically feasible.   The original Board consisted of:   Margot Anthony, Arthur Birch, John Bruce, Rupert Cater, Penelope Chapman; Michael Edgley; the Hon. Russell Fox; Lady Heydon; Ross Hohnen; L. Engledow; Arthur Kenyon; Richard Kingsland; Leonie Kramer; David Purnell.   The Secretarial staff was drawn primarily from the Department of the Capital Territory, which also provided office accommodation. The main records created by Festival Australia were the minutes of the Board's and of the Committee's meetings and correspondence, handled by the Secretariat.   By ordinance No. 34 of 1978 the Government dissolved the current Board of Governors which had last been amended by Ordinance No. 14 of 1976. Whilst ordinance No 34 did not dissolve the corporation itself, it virtually suspended the Board's activities by not making any new appointments  In future appointment would be made by instrument in writing by the Minister of State for the Capital Territory and would consist of the following:-   2 officers or employees of the Department of the Capital Territory; 1 officer or employee of the Department of the Prime Minister and      Cabinet; 1 officer or employee of the Department of Finance; 1 member of the Legislative Assembly; The Minister of State for the Capital Territory   The ordinance also stated that the rights, privileges, obligations and liabilities of the Corporation immediately before 26 October 1978 should be rested in the Commonwealth, and that the Commonwealth should also be substituted for the Corporation in any legal proceedings.(5)   As this ordinance only suspended the activities of the Board and did not abolish the organisation itself, the closing date of the date range of this agency had been taken as 1979, the year in which Festival Australia Inc. is no longer listed in the Commonwealth Directory as an organisation for which the Minister for the Capital Territory is responsible.   This information was drawn primarily from the Australian Government Directory. 1974 and  1979; from the Festival Australia Incorporation Ordinance 1973, from the records created by Festival Australia; and from Mr W.E Lawrence, present member of the Board of Governors.

The Ordinance was gazetted on 21 June 1965 (1) and trustees were appointed on 22 June. (2) Under Section 4(2) of the Ordinance the Trust was established as a body corporate, with a common seal, the ability to acquire, hold and dispose of real and personal property and the ability to sue or be sued in its corporate name. Under Section 4(3) of the ordinance all courts, judges and persons acting judicially were required to take judicial notice of the common seal of the trust affixed to a document and to assume that it was duly affixed. Under Section 17 of the Ordinance, the functions of the Trust were stated as being: a) to occupy the Canberra Theatre Centre, and to use and manage it as a concert hall, theatre and place of assembly for the presentation of artistic and cultural entertainments displays and exhibitions and other forms of entertainment and instruction; b) to promote and encourage the development and presentation of the arts; c) to promote and encourage public interest and participation in, and appreciation of, the arts; c) to the extent that the Canberra Theatre Centre is not required for the purposes of the performance of the foregoing functions, to make it available for public and other meetings, and for conventions, receptions and other gatherings. Under Section 18(1) of the Ordinance the Trust was empowered to do all things necessary or convenient to be done in connection with, or as incidental to, the performance of its functions. Section 18 (2a-2f) details particular powers of the Trust in relation to contracts, purchase, granting of rights to use the Theatre, admission charges, recording and broadcasting and provision of public facilities (restaurant etc). Under Section 30 of the Ordinance, the Trust was required to furnish the Minister such information relating to its operations as the Minister from time to time requires. Under Section 32 (1) of the Ordinance, the trust was required, as soon as practicable after each thirteenth day of June, to furnish to the Minister a report of its operations during the year ended on that date, together with financial statements, in such form as the Minister of State for finance approves, in respect of that year. Under Section 6 and Section 7 of the Ordinance the Trust was to be constituted by a Chairman, a Deputy Chairman and seven other trustees. All trustees were to be appointed by the Minister for the Interior [II] (and later for the Capital Territory). Six trustees constituted a quorum, voting being decided by a majority of votes. The first trustees were: Leslie Bruce Hamilton, Stefan Haag, John Casson, Ian Maclean, Hector William Crawford, Clement William Semmler, Arthur Thomas Shakespeare, George Alexander Currie and Richard Kingsland. These were appointed for a period of one year, however, Section 6(2) of the Ordinance states that the Minister may appoint trustees for a period not exceeding five years. Under Section 22 of the Ordinance the Trust may employ such persons as it thinks necessary, the terms and conditions (including remuneration) of such employment to be determined by the Trust, subject to any directions of the Minister.

Therefore on 3 September 1976 the Australian Art Exhibitions Corporation (AAEC) Limited was established as a company owned by the Australia Council. The AAEC, together with another organisation, the Australian GalleryDirector's Council, successfully managed several exhibitions including the El Dorado-Colombian Gold Exhibition (in 1978) and the Pompeii Exhibition (in 1980). Both agencies however, experienced financial difficulties and ultimately went into liquidation. In 1979 the Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon R.J. Ellicott, initiated the first moves towards establishing a Commonwealth organisation which would specialise in international exhibitions. On 16 May 1980 the first board of Directors of the International Cultural Corporation of Australia (ICCA) was appointed and held the inaugural meeting. The agency however, was formally incorporated on 24 June 1980. It was a Commonwealth-owned company registered in the Australian Capital Territory. The major aim of the Corporation is to bring to Australia significant international exhibitions and displays of art, antiquities and other items of artistic, cultural and historical interest. It also aims to send overseas the best of Australian art, antiquities and related items. The Corporation is entrepreneurial in its methods of operation and seeks sponsorship from the private sector. It offers its expertise and assistance to the Federal and State Governments and to museums and galleries. For the first four years of operation ICCA received a grant of $250,000 from the Australian Government. The agency's title changed to Art Exhibitions Australia Limited in March 1991. The charter of the company is to manage exhibitions and displays of art, antiquities and other cultural or historical material. The company functions as a self-funding, non-profit body governed by a Board of Directors who serve in an honorary capacity. The initial Chairman of the company was Mr James Leslie, Chairman and Managing Director of Mobil Oil Australia Ltd and the Board comprised as follows: Mr Norman Baker, Arthur Young and Co (Deputy Chairman) Dr Jean Battersby, CEO, Australia Council Mr Franco Belgiorno-Nettis, Managing Director, Transfield Group Mr Edmund Capon, Director, Art Gallery of NSW Ms Betty Churcher, Director, Australian National Gallery Mr Michael Darling, Managing Director, Clayton Robard Ltd Mr Robert Edwards, Director, Museum of Victoria (Chief Executive) Mrs Ann Lewis, Co-publisher of Xpress magazine Hon. Mr Justice John Lockhart, Judge of the Federal Court Mr Alan McGregor, grazier Mr Robert S. McKay Since its inception the following exhibitions have been arranged and managed by the Corporation: Aboriginal Art, Australian Pictorial Photography, Chinese Paintings of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, Fabulous Fashions 1907-1967, Australian Exhibition, Modern Commonwealth, Australian Heritage, Chinese Landscape Photography, Japan - Masterpieces from the Idemitsu Collection, Kandinsky Exhibition, Leonardo da Vinci Anatomical Drawings, Commonwealth Arts Festival; and Xian Exhibition, Terracotta Figures, China Records created by the Corporation include correspondence, financial documentation, newspaper clippings, catalogues, videocassettes and photographs. Exhibitions managed by ICCA (up to March 1991) were indemnified by the Commonwealth. The succeeding company, Art Exhibitions Australia Limited, was entered on the Register of Cultural Organisations established under Section 78(1)(a) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, listing bodies eligible to receive tax deductible donations. The company maintains close links with the Commonwealth arts portfolio and continues to receive indemnity on exhibitions.

Items from Artbank's collection are available on lease for display in Commonwealth Government offices and other agencies in Australia and overseas. Clients are encouraged to place these works wherever large numbers of people meet, eg reception areas, foyers, etc. In this way they are enabling more Australians to become familiar with the works of their contemporaries.   Artbank's Acquisitions Advisory Committee chooses works of art from items submitted by the Director. These works can then be leased for an annual rental fee of 12% of their current market value. This Committee meets regularly in State capital cities. As at 1980 it was intended to establish Selection Advisory Panels in the States.    The first Director of Artbank was Mr Graeme Sturgeon. The first Board of Artbank was Mr Richard Crebbin, Ms Sue Walker, Mr Kenneth Jack and Mr Carl Andrew.

This Act changed the functions of the School, as originally established, by giving it responsibility for training in the areas of radio broadcasting and audio-visual communications. The name of the School was changed to Australian Film, Television and Radio School by the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, to properly reflect the functions of the school.  It retained its previous functions of education and training in film and television for both students and professionals, and the administration of financial grants. (1)  As part of the change in function the School established a Radio Unit which, in 1979, began by providing services and training to Aboriginal broadcasters. In 1981 the School installed a broadcast standard studio and began training for all sectors of radio broadcasting. At this time it also began a course in commercial radio techniques. (2)  Professor Jerzy Toeplitz who had been appointed director of the original Film and Television School (CA 1617) was replaced in 1980 by A.S. Walton. (3)  In 1985 (9 May) Walton was replaced by Ms Anne Deveson. (4)  The new Director instituted an examination of the School's activities which resulted in a report entitled \"New Directions Review\".  This review found gaps in the School's performance and recommended that the School: place greater emphasis on television training; increase training for aboriginals in the film, video, and television areas; increase the involvement of the School with industry; increase training in entrepreneurial skills; monitor technological developments in the industry; and introduced a new program to enable professionals to experiment. The main aim of the change in direction was to make the School more relevant to the professional needs of the industry and to reduce costs by increasing cooperation with other organisations. (5) The Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1986 changed the name of the School to the Australian Film, Television and Radio School.  In June 1986 work commenced on the School's first permanent home, a site within the grounds of Macquarie University, North Ryde.

The functions of the Institute are:   (a) to conduct in the Australian Capital Territory, an     educational institution for the purpose of fostering the     achievement of excellence in the study, at tertiary and other     levels, of -                        (i) music;           (ii) visual arts and crafts; and          (iii) such other fields of the arts as the Board, with the                 approval of the Minister determines or the Minister                requires.   (b) to provide courses and programs, and to use the facilities     and resources of the Institute, to advance and develop knowledge     and skills;   (c) to promote the development of community awareness and     appreciation of the arts;   (d) to award degrees, diplomas and certificates in accordance with     the statutes;   (e) to consult and co-operate with other institutions and with         persons, associations, organisations and authorities, concerned     with the provision of education and training in the arts; and   (f) to do anything incidental to any of the foregoing.     From 23 October 1990 to 1 January 1992, the Institute was funded jointly by the Commonwealth and Australian Capital Territory  Government's.   In July 1989, an affiliation agreement was made between the Institute and the Australian National University (ANU).  As a result of this, discussions took place on the feasibility of amalgamation from the beginning of 1991.   The new arrangement was designed to achieve autonomy for the Institute, while giving students academic and administrative benefits by being aligned to a larger institution.  It would also preserve the relationship between the Institute and the Canberra community.   The amending legislation for the amalgamation was not ready by 1 January 1991.  Instead, amendments to the existing Australian National University Act were assented to by Parliament on 2 September 1991 and confirmed the establishment of an institute previously known as the Canberra Institute of the Arts within the University to take effect from 1 January 1992.    The Institute would be known as the Institute of the Arts and included the Canberra School of Music and the Canberra School of Art.   The amended Australian National University Act 1991, No. 131 of 1991, also repealed the Canberra Institute of the Arts Ordinance 1988.   The internal structure of the newly established Institute of the Arts remained as before except that it was now governed by a Board responsible to the Council of the University.   The University was given the power to employ staff, enrol students and grant a degree, diploma or certificate of the Institute of the Arts. The assets and liabilities of the Institute also became those of the University.

A National Broadcasting Symphony Orchestra participated in the opening night ABC program on July 1, 1932.  There was early intention by ABC management to set up a symphony orchestra in each State.  First use of the name Melbourne Symphony Orchestra was in 1906, this orchestra was founded by Alberto Zelman, junior.  During the period 1932 - 36 orchestras performing for an ABC concert were announced as, \"appearing under the auspices of\", \"in association with\", or by courtesy of\" the University of Melbourne.  This was in recognition of the fact that the University 'owned' the name but was prepared to allow the ABC to take over administrative control of the orchestra and use the name ABC (Melbourne) Symphony Orchestra.  The first year of a permanent ABC orchestra in Victoria was 1949.  This orchestra was called the Victorian Symphony Orchestra at the insistence of the Victorian Government.    It was not until 1965 when the name reverted to Melbourne Symphony Orchestra under the then Premier Sir Henry Bolte.  By 1957 the last of the State Symphony Orchestras had been set up.  Development of the ABC's six symphony orchestras has taken 25 years from the modest beginnings [1932].  The ABC was by then possibly the largest single comprehensive concert giving organisation in the world.

Under the Tasmanian Orchestra Agreement Act of 1948, the Tasmanian Government was authorised to enter into an agreement with the ABC for the establishment of an orchestra to be known as the Tasmanian Orchestra.  The agreement provided that the ABC establish the Tasmanian Orchestra as from March 1948.  During 1972 it was decided that it would be known in future as the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra (TSO) on all occasions.  The TSO is the smallest of the six ABC orchestras.  It entrepreneurs its own subscription series of concerts in Hobart and Launceston, tours Tasmanian regional centres, plays for visiting ballet companies, performs free outdoor concerts, has a comprehensive education program, and has received wide exposure via recordings, national broadcasts and television appearances.  The ABC is responsible for the management and control of the orchestra and also provides funding for a bulk of the operational costs with further funding provided from the Tasmanian Government, local councils and corporate sponsorship.  In 1985 the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Concert Music Department was formed incorporating the TSO.  As a result the TSO was given greater autonomy of management to be more responsible to local needs.

The Board consisted of four members, who were appointed to assist the Historic Memorials Committee (CA 290) in their decisions to commemorate and preserve \"for the public in oil or in stone, likenesses of prominent statesmen of Australia\". (2)   To this end, the Board, acting in an honorary capacity, advised the Committee in the matters of selecting the artists, choosing the types of memorials (i.e. paintings, sculptures etc.) and determining the payments for artists and artworks.   These duties were the primary functions of the Board, but in time it was also the Board's responsibility \"to advise the government in relation to the acquisition of works of art, exhibitions and art matters generally\". (3) The composition of the first Board was as follows: Hugh Paterson - Chairman G.V.F. Mann James Ashton D.S. Thistlethwayte   Hugh Paterson, the Chairman, was a personal friend of Andrew Fisher (later Prime Minister from 1908-1915 with short intervals) and brother of J. Ford Paterson, the artist.  Paterson himself was a successful business man in house painting and decorating and also a moderate artist.  It was Paterson who persuaded Fisher originally to do something to help Australian art and artists, resulting in the establishment of the Historic Memorials Committee in 1911 and the Art Advisory Board a year later.  Of the remaining three members, two were involved in artistic circles.  G.V.F. Mann, born in 1863, was an architect and a painter and Director of the National Art Gallery of New South Wales, when he was appointed to the Art Advisory Board.  James Ashton, born 1860, was an artist and teacher and Member of the Royal Society of Arts, as well as the Royal Drawing Society.  His son, Will Ashton became a well known artist and replaced his father as a member on the Art Advisory Board in 1918, an association that continued until 1961. (4)  Members continued to be chosen from the artistic milieu throughout the existence of the Board.  The Secretary, however, who also served as Secretary for the Historic Memorials Committee (CA 290), was a public servant, working in the Prime Minister's Department.  The first two secretaries - M.L. Shepherd (CP25) and P.E. Deane (CP78) - were both Secretaries to the Department of the Prime Minister and their primary duties were to the functioning of that Department.  The succeeding secretaries of the Board usually held public service positions at the Assistant Secretary level and were men with expertise in the cultural and welfare areas of the Prime Minister's Department.  At one stage the name of the Board changed with the addition \"Commonwealth\" to the title between (Aug.) 1958 and (Oct.) 1959.  The political changes of March 1971 and December 1972 led to administration reorganisations, which put the Board at various times under three different controlling Departments, eventually ending with the demise of the Board. Early correspondence and newspaper items in the records concerning both the Board and the Committee (held by Australian Archives) reveal that even before the formal establishment of the Art Advisory Board, advertisements were being placed in the Commonwealth Gazettes and letters written to various artists commissioning them to paint \"the pictures for the Commonwealth Gallery of Distinguished Australians\". (5)   Explicit instructions were issued to the chosen artists and those rules and regulations appeared to have been strictly adhered to. (6) In the early period of the Board's life, many Australian artists were working in Europe and it was decided to nominate a London representative, Dr Bertram Mackennal, ARA, of St John's Wood, London \"to act as the Art Advisory Board's representative in London in order to see that the commissions in the hands of such artists may be proceeded with in a satisfactory manner in terms of contract\". (7) In time the Board acquired additional responsibilities, such as the purchase of works of art, both early and modern Australian works as well as contemporary international art.  This is now housed in the Australian National Gallery in Canberra. The Board also organised and financed official Government exhibitions of Australian art overseas and contributed towards the cost of exhibitions from overseas in Australia. (8)  The Art Advisory Board came to an end on 16 February 1973, when a new policy for the arts was formulated by the Labour Government.  The Australian Council for the Arts [II] (CA 1615) came into being in February 1973, when the Labour Government announced their intention to establish the Australian Council for the Arts as a statutory authority.  This new Council was given the responsibility of preparing a report on the future shape and working arrangements for a continuing authority in the arts.  The basis of this Council was a number of boards each dealing with different areas of the arts.  Amongst the group to be established was the Visual and Plastic Arts Board  (9), also known as the Visual Arts Board, which assumed many of the functions of the Commonwealth Art Advisory Board, including advising the Historic Memorials Committee on the commissioning of portraits, but not those relating to acquisitions for the Australian National Gallery.

The Board was set up to promote, assist and co-ordinate the production, distribution and importation of films for the purpose of school and adult education; rehabilitation; social development; international understanding; trade and tourist extension and immigration.  Among the recommendations adopted by the full Cabinet were that the Board for administrative purposes should be attached to the Department of Information, and that Department would be the Commonwealth authority responsible for the production of films recommended by the Board. The Cabinet decision carried with it provision of funds for the purposes of the Board and the film work of the Department of Information.  The necessity of such a Board had been evident for many years. The Board had a domestic as well as an overseas publicity function. The technical facilities and the personnel of the Department of Information (including the Cinema Branch) were available to the board as a readily available trained nucleus.  The Board, which had been meeting very infrequently during the early 1970s, had its final meeting on 30 November 1972, the minutes being signed as a true record of the last meeting on  1 March 1973. The activities of the Board were then taken over by the Australian Film Development Corporation.

Hon. Harold Holt made a Ministerial statement in the House of Representative on Australian Cultural Activities in which he announced the establishment of an Australian Council.   He stated that \"the Council will co-operate closely with the Elizabethan Theatre Trust and with existing Commonwealth Government agencies responsible for music, painting and literature\" (Ibid): Mr Holt continued that Government financial assistance for the \"theatre Arts - drama, opera and ballet, and film-making for television with an educational and cultural emphasis\" would be channelled through the new Council for the Arts. The Council would also advise the Government on special requests for aid in cultural activities not already covered by Government agencies, and which, in the past, have been dealt with on an ad hoc basis (Ibid).   It was not however until 5 June 1968 that the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. John Gorton announced the names of the members of the Council. The Chairman was Dr. H.C Coombs, and the members Ms E. Archdale, Ms J. Bradley, W.P. Coleman MLA, Geoffrey Dutton, Ms G.D Erwin, Mr W.H. Houghton, B. Jones, Dr K. Langer and Professor K.C. Masterman (Sydney Morning Herald, 5 June 1972 p.11).  The Chairman of the Council was appointed for a period of five years and the nine members were representative of all States and the Australian Capital Territory. (Report of the Auditor-General, 1968-9, paragraph 207).   The appointment of Dr Jean Battersby as Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Council for the Arts was announced by Dr H.C. Coombs on 2 October 1968.  He said that Dr Battersby \"would be responsible to the Council for the organisation of studies of various aspects of the Arts and for the formulation for consideration by the Council, of Federal submissions to the Federal Government\".  (Sydney Morning Herald, 2 October 1968 p.2)   Commonwealth grants to the performing arts through the recommendations of the Australian Council for the Arts totalled $1,666,349 in 1968-9; $2,659,244 in 1969-70; $3,793,062 in 1970-1; $4,493,153 in 1971-2; and $5,733,643 in 1972-3. (Reports of the Auditor-General upon the Treasurer's statement of receipts and expenditure 1968-9, 1969-70, 1970-1, 1971-2, 1972-3).   The establishment of a new Council for the Arts was foreshadowed in November 1972 by the then Leader of the Opposition, E.G Whitlam when he announced the policies of the Labour Party for the arts.  He set out four broad objectives, namely to encourage excellence in the arts, to foster a wider spread of interest and participation, to help develop a national identity through artistic expression and to project Australia's image in other countries by means of the arts.  He proposed a statutory council devolving wide responsibilities on Boards for various art forms (Australian Council for the Arts, First Annual Report, January to December, 1973 p 9).   In January 1973 a new Council was established when the new Prime Minister the Rt. Hon. (E) Gough Whitlam announced a major reorganisation of Federal Government involvement in the arts.  He invited twenty-four people to form a new Council \"with a charter to ensure a continuity of support to existing recipients so that past government commitments might be honoured, to prepare a budget for the increased help which the Government had undertaken to provide and to prepare detailed plans for a Statutory Authority broadly based on the proposals outlined in the policy speech\" (Ibid).   In February 1973, the membership of the seven specialist constituent Boards was announced.  \"Approximately one third of the people appointed had been members of bodies advising the previous Government.

The four broad objectives outlined in the Policy Speech were:   a) to encourage excellence in the arts; b) to foster a wider spread of interest and participation; c) to help develop a national identity through artistic expression    Industry/activity class: d) to project Australia's image in other countries by means of the    arts.   The speech also proposed a statutory Council involving wide responsibilities on Boards for various art forms.   Once the Labor Government came into power, moves were made to give effect to the above proposals and in January 1973 the Prime Minister the Rt. Hon. Gough Whitlam invited twenty-four people to form a new Council with a charter to ensure a continuity of support to existing recipients so that past government commitments might be honoured, to prepare a budget for the increased help which the government had undertaken to provide and to prepare detailed plans for a statutory authority broadly based on the proposals outlined in the Policy Speech.   The membership of the Council included four categories of people. The majority were prominent artists and persons closely involved in the arts including the Chairmen of the various Boards. They were supported by others with legal, financial and other administrative skills, with however, a known interest in the arts, and by several senior officials of government departments and agencies whose work interlocked with that of the council.   The council met for the first time on 16 February 1973 and rapidly assembled a draft report which was tabled in Parliament by the Prime Minister on 24 May 1973 on the shape and working arrangements for a continuing authority in the arts.  After considerable debate on the issues raised in the above report a final version was sent to the Prime Minister and approved by Cabinet in November 1973.   The Australia Council, the establishment of which was recommended by the above reports, was established on 13 March 1975 by the Australia Council Act 1975.

The School was set up as the national training facility for film and television professionals.  The functions of the School, as outlined in the Act, were to: provide education and training; conduct and encourage research; conduct seminars and other such courses for professionals; co-operate with other television bodies with respect to program production; offer facilities to professionals for the purposes of program production; make grants of financial assistance; and award degrees, diplomas, and certificates in relation to the educational courses offered by the school. The Act further stated that the \"School shall exercise its functions with a view to enabling and encouraging the production of films and television programs of a high degree of creativeness and of high technical and artistic standards\". (2)  Under the Act the School was to be governed by a body to be known as the Council of the Film and Television School. The Council consisted of the Director of the School, two members of the staff of the School elected by the staff, two students of the School elected by the student body, and five members appointed by the Governor-General. (3)  The first Council of the School consisted of:  Chairman: Barry Jones, MLA Members: J. Bailey          H. Crawford          J. Flaus          G. Healy          J. Long (Deputy Chairman)          R.K. Mason          J.H.M. Oswin          B. Robinson          P. Weir  The first Director of the School was Professor Jerzy Toeplitz, formerly of Poland's National Film School and the first Assistant Director was John Martin-Jones.  The School offered its first courses in 1973. Two courses were offered: the full-time program for full time students, usually not experienced in the industry, and the open program for professionals in the film and television area. The School also administered, from its first year of operation, various grants-in-aid to enable suitably qualified people to benefit from study, experience, or training in Australia or overseas. (5)  The School began its operations at 2 Help Street, Chatswood, the former offices of the Interim Council of the School. Land was acquired at North Ryde and by April 1975 the School was able to move from Chatswood and hold its courses at North Ryde.  On 29 October 1976 the Film and Television Act was amended by the insertion of the word 'Australian' before 'Film', and by the addition to the School's functions of responsibility for training and education in the areas of radio broadcasting and audio-visual communications.

Under Section 21 part 1 the Corporation has power:   (a) to make loans on such terms and conditions, including conditions     as to repayments of principal and payment of interest, as the     Corporation thinks fit, to producers of Australian films;    (b) to guarantee -       (i) the due repayment of loans made to producers of Australian           films; and      (ii) the due payment of interest on such loans.   (c) to provide financial assistance to producers of Australian films     under arrangements that entitle the Corporation to receive a     share of the proceeds derived from the sale, hire or exhibition     of the films or, the inclusion of the films in television     programmes but do not render the Corporation liable for any debts     incurred by those producers; and   (d) subject to the approval of the Minister, to form, or participate     with another person in the formation of a company for the purpose     of carrying on business, of the distribution of Australian films     and to acquire, hold and dispose of shares or stock in the     capital of a company carrying on such a business.   By Section 18 one million dollars was appropriated for the Corporation.   Under Section 6 the Corporation was to consist of a Chairman and four other members appointed by the Governor-General, and under Section 22 there was also to be an Executive Officer to manage the affairs of the Corporation.   This Act was assented to on 17 June 1970 and the Corporation was established by Proclamation on 17 August 1970 (Commonwealth Gazette, 17 August 1970, p 5687).   The Board of the Corporation, announced by the Prime Minister the Rt Hon John Gorton on 17 August 1970 was:  Chairman J Darling, and members D E Brown, MBE, T S Duckmanton, CBE, R S Elliott and Barry Jones. (The Australian, 18 August 1970, p 2).   By April 1974 the Corporation was providing money to the Australian film industry at an average of $130,000 per month and had been involved in the production of both feature films and films for television.  The feature films include \"Alvin Purple\", \"The Adventures of Barry McKenzie\", \"The Cars That Ate Paris\", \"Petersen\", and \"Between Wars\".   The Corporation had also helped finance the T.V documentaries 'Wild Country'- Channel 7 and 'Poisoned Dart'- Channel 10, and has provided assistance for television series including 'Ryan', 'Homicide', 'Boney', 'Silent Number', and 'Seven Little Australians'. (Department of the Media, A Review of Activities, April 1974, pp 43-47).   In a press statement on 10 December 1973, the Minister for the Media, Senator the Hon Douglas McClelland, in announcing the proposed legislation to establish an Australian Film Commission stated that the Commission would replace the Australian Film Development Corporation which would be disbanded.  (Sydney Morning Herald, 13 February 1974, p 22).   On 28 September 1974 the Australian Film Commission Bill 1974 was presented to Parliament but was rejected by the Senate on 3 December 1974. The Australian Film Commission Act was finally assented to on 7 March 1975.   However, under the terms of the Act, the Australian Film Development Corporation Act 1970 and the Australian Film Development Corporation Act (No 2) 1970, continued to be extant, as Part VI of the Act covering the repeal of these acts had to be proclaimed separately. Part VI was proclaimed on 8 July 1975 and from that date \"all rights property and assets (including the moneys standing to the credit of the Australian Film Development Fund) that immediately before [..date of proclamation..] were vested in the Australian Film Development Corporation, [were] ... vested in the Commission\".

Cabinet agreed that an independent statutory body as recommended by the Tariff Board be established, but that the structure and membership should be a matter for further consideration between the Minister for the Media, The Treasurer and The Public Service Board. It authorised Senator McClelland to proceed with the establishment of an interim board of the Australian Film Commission so work may be commenced in the planning stages. (The Media, A collection of speeches made by the Minister for the Media, Senator The Honourable Douglas McClelland during the period 16 June - 10 December 1973, Appendix 2).  On 12 February 1974 Senator McClelland announced the membership of The Interim Board of the Film Commission stating that the Board \"is expected to operate for about six months before the Commission's permanent board is approved by Parliament\" (Sydney Morning Herald 13 February 1974 p. 22). Members were Messrs. J. Darling (Chairman), R. Elliott, L. Beioley, G. Burke, H. Crawford, J. McQuaid, J. Oswin, S. Walton, R. Whitbread, Sir Keith Waller and Joan Long. The first meeting was held on 27 February 1974, and the Broadcasting and Film Division of the Department of the Media was given the responsibility of preparing more than 50 briefing papers for the Interim Board to assist its consideration of matters associated with the establishment and operation of the Australian Film Commission (Department of the Media, Report for 1 July 1973 - 30 June 1974 p. 8).  On 26 September 1974 the Australian Film Commission Bill 1974 was presented to Parliament but was rejected by the Senate on 3 December, 1974. The Bill was presented again in early 1975 and was assented to on 7 March 1975. The Interim Board continued to function until 5 May 1975 when the full-time Board of the Australian Film Commission was appointed.

The functions of the Commission are to encourage and finance \"the making, promotion, distribution and exhibition of Australian Films\". It was also given powers to make, promote and exhibit film on behalf of Departments of State and in the national interest of Australia. The Act also gave the Commission the powers previously exercised by the Australian Film Development Corporation (CA 1666), although these functions were not taken over until 8 July 1975 when Part VI of the Australian Film Commission which repealed the Australian Film Development Corporation Act was proclaimed. In April 1975 considerable controversy in the Australian film industry surrounded a letter written by the then Minister for the Media Senator Douglas McClelland inviting Mr Jack Valenti, President of the Motion Picture Association of America to suggest names of people suitable for the board of the newly-formed Commission. Following the nature of this letter becoming public knowledge the Minister compiled a list of Australian nominees recommended for appointment to the Film Commission (Sydney Morning Herald 14 April 1975 p. 3) On 15 April 1975 Senator McClelland announced the membership of the Commission. Initial appointments to the Commission consisted of four full-time and four part-time members whose appointments dated from 5 May 1975: Full-time Members: Mr K.

Walter Moffit Marks MP was appointed Chairman of the Commission and the Commissioners were Senator Walter Leslie Duncan, Senator John Grant, Senator the Hon Herbert Hays, Francis Michael Forde MP, the Hon Henry Gregory MP and Lewis Windemere Nott MP. Mr A A Tregear was Secretary of the Commission and Mr T C Pittaway was Assistant Secretary.   The Commission was to \"inquire into and report on the moving picture industry in Australia and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to inquire particularly into:   1. the importation, production, distribution and exhibition of moving    picture films;   2. the incidence and effect of the customs tariff upon the    importation of such films and the sufficiency or otherwise of    existing duties of customs;   3. the sufficiency or otherwise of the existing income tax law of the    Commonwealth in relation to persons, firms and companies engaged    in the industry; and   4. the connection with any and all of the foregoing matters, the    income, profits, expenditure and losses of such persons, firms and    companies derived from or incurred in connection with the    industry, and the amount of capital invested in the industry.\"   Evidence was taken in all the capital cities of Australia and in certain states where local problems of distribution and exhibition warranted it. 147 sittings were held and 253 witnesses were examined, evidence being taken in camera where necessary.   The four divisions of the motion picture industry were dealt with separately; namely the importation, distribution, exhibition and production of films.   The fifty recommendations of the Commission included:   . that a Board of Film Censors should be established consisting of   two men and a woman;   . that there should also be a Censorship Board of Appeal consisting   of five members, on which the motion picture industry would not be   represented;   . all film distributors in Australia should be registered and   contracts for distribution limited to 12 months;   . all motion picture exhibitors should be registered and the films   screened by them subject to the Commonwealth Censorship Board;    . the Appeal Board should issue Awards for Merit for the   encouragement of film production in Australia;   . a quota system should be introduced ensuring an increasing   percentage of Empire produced feature films, 5 in the first year   increasing to 15 in the third year;   . films shown in Mandated Territories should be passed by the   Censorship Board as suitable for that specific exhibition;   . films should be graded by the Censorship Board as \"suitable for   Universal Exhibition\" and \"For Adults Only\" with those shown at   matinees for children being only of the former type;   . educational films in the States should be assisted in every way by   the Commonwealth;   . taxation of gross earnings remitted to America by Australian Branch   companies should be reconsidered;   . British agencies should be established for the distribution of   their own films; and   . customs tariffs on British films should be continued with   reciprocal tariff preference for Australian films entering Britain   and other parts of the Empire.

The first meeting was held in Sydney on 23 September 1932 and J H Keating appeared as Counsel to assist the Commission and represent the public. Many companies were represented at this meeting and at subsequent meetings further associations, societies and bodies were represented, members of the public supplied information and gave evidence also. There were 67 sittings, 60 witnesses gave evidence and 169 exhibits were produced.   The Australasian Performing Rights Association Ltd which was incorporated on 4 January 1926 had a close association with the Performing Rights Society (Britain) in that this Society had a representative on the Board of Directors of the Australian Association, neither was profit making. In his Report the Commissioner commended the Association for its organisation and methods of distributing moneys to authors, composers, publishers and others. However, the super-monopoly of the Association in controlling over 80% of the best music which was subject to copyright meant that it controlled the music performed in public and dictated its own terms.   The Commissioner recommended that there should be a Tribunal to determine disputes arising out of the performances in public of musical works and for the use of records in public; that the Australasian Performing Rights Association should compile from time to time a list of musical works requiring licence; that there should be regular filing of accounts of the receipts and distribution of fees collected by the Australasian Performing Rights Association probably at the nearest Copyright Office; that no fees should be paid for relay broadcasting provided the initial fee had been paid and no charges made where the performance was not directly for private profit or was for religious, educational or charitable purposes.

The idea of such festival held in Canberra had been mooted as early as 1968 by the Canberra Theatre Trust. A group of people were brought together within the Department of the Capital Territory to make preparations for the Festival planed for March 1975. The Ordinance governing the Activities of Festival Australia was drawn up in the Department of the Capital Territory, and by the Ordinance the Board of Governors was appointed.(1)  A number of committees were also set up by the Ordinance Schedule. They were:   Programme - Arts Committee, Programme - Science Committee, Finance Committee, Public Relations Committee, Community Participation Committee. (2)   The Minister of State for the Department of the Capital Territory was to be the Chairman of the Board of Governors. The City Manager (from the Department of the Capital Territory) was to be Deputy Chairman. The Board members were people of substantial standing in the fields of the arts and science.   The Festival Australia body was incorporated to organise and raise funds for a national festival of the creative arts and sciences. It was empowered 'to promote and encourage Australia arts, science and technology'(3) by organising exhibitions, festival (music, drama, films and so forth), lectures and other performances in the fields of the arts and sciences in suitable venues in Canberra. It was therefore enabled to employ persons, to engage venues and raise funds for the purpose of holding festivals.     In the Constitutions of Festival Australia sixteen objects and powers were outlined. The major objects and powers were described as:   \"(a) to promote and encourage Australian arts, science and technology and for these purpose to organise, promote manage and conduct festivals of music drama and other entertainments and exhibitions, demonstrations, expositions, lectures and other activities in Canberra or elsewhere annually or at such intervals as Festival Australia may determine;   (b) to present, produce, manage and conduct at theatres, halls galleries, cinemas, lecture theatres and other premises and open spaces activities such as operas, plays, dramas, ballets, concerts, recitals, exhibitions, readings, demonstrations, expositions, lectures, cinematographic performances and other entertainments or activities as may tend to promote and encourage Australian arts, science and technology;   (c) to engage, and employ persons and bodies corporate to produce and present such operas, plays, dramas, ballets, concerts, recitals, exhibitions, readings, demonstrations, expositions, lectures, cinematographic performances and other entertainments or activities as may tend to promote and encourage Australian arts, science and technology;   (d) to engage  employ or sponsor persons and bodies corporate to conduct or engage in research or any other activities as may tend to promote and encourage Australian arts, science or technology,   (e) to make and carry out ... arrangements... for the presentation of operas, plays, dramas, ballets, concerts, recitals, exhibitions, reading, demonstrations [etc] as may tend to promote and encourage Australian arts, science or technology..;   (f) to engage in the sale and distribution of admission tickets to entertainment or instruction conducted by or on behalf of Festival Australia;   (h) to establish such courses of study, and award such scholarships, as will enable the objects of Festival Australia to be best attained;   (i) to provide and maintain such libraries and a associated facilities as are necessary or desirable for carrying out the objects of Festival Australia;   (j) to raise money for the purpose of Festival Australia....,   (k) to invest the funds of Festival Australia or under its charge and not immediately required upon such securities or investments as the Board may from time to time determine;   (l) to undertake and execute any trusts the undertaking where or may be incidental to the attainment of the objects of Festival Australia or any of them;   (m) to establish and support and aid in the establishment and support of any associations or institutions which have for their objects the promotions, or encouragement of Australia arts, science or technology on the study of the arts, science or technology   (n) to provide meeting places, clubs and other social amenities in connection with festivals organised or promoted by Festival Australia.   (o) to acquire, hold, purchase, lease, sell, exchange, mortgage and dispose of any form of property real or personal for the purposes of Festival Australia.(4)   The original intention was that such a national festival should be held biennially, but after the first festival, Australia,'75, it was decided that this was not economically feasible.   The original Board consisted of:   Margot Anthony, Arthur Birch, John Bruce, Rupert Cater, Penelope Chapman; Michael Edgley; the Hon. Russell Fox; Lady Heydon; Ross Hohnen; L. Engledow; Arthur Kenyon; Richard Kingsland; Leonie Kramer; David Purnell.   The Secretarial staff was drawn primarily from the Department of the Capital Territory, which also provided office accommodation. The main records created by Festival Australia were the minutes of the Board's and of the Committee's meetings and correspondence, handled by the Secretariat.   By ordinance No. 34 of 1978 the Government dissolved the current Board of Governors which had last been amended by Ordinance No. 14 of 1976. Whilst ordinance No 34 did not dissolve the corporation itself, it virtually suspended the Board's activities by not making any new appointments  In future appointment would be made by instrument in writing by the Minister of State for the Capital Territory and would consist of the following:-   2 officers or employees of the Department of the Capital Territory; 1 officer or employee of the Department of the Prime Minister and      Cabinet; 1 officer or employee of the Department of Finance; 1 member of the Legislative Assembly; The Minister of State for the Capital Territory   The ordinance also stated that the rights, privileges, obligations and liabilities of the Corporation immediately before 26 October 1978 should be rested in the Commonwealth, and that the Commonwealth should also be substituted for the Corporation in any legal proceedings.(5)   As this ordinance only suspended the activities of the Board and did not abolish the organisation itself, the closing date of the date range of this agency had been taken as 1979, the year in which Festival Australia Inc. is no longer listed in the Commonwealth Directory as an organisation for which the Minister for the Capital Territory is responsible.   This information was drawn primarily from the Australian Government Directory. 1974 and  1979; from the Festival Australia Incorporation Ordinance 1973, from the records created by Festival Australia; and from Mr W.E Lawrence, present member of the Board of Governors.

Under Section 17 of the Ordinance, the functions of the Trust were stated as being: a) to occupy the Canberra Theatre Centre, and to use and manage it as a concert hall, theatre and place of assembly for the presentation of artistic and cultural entertainments displays and exhibitions and other forms of entertainment and instruction; b) to promote and encourage the development and presentation of the arts; c) to promote and encourage public interest and participation in, and appreciation of, the arts; c) to the extent that the Canberra Theatre Centre is not required for the purposes of the performance of the foregoing functions, to make it available for public and other meetings, and for conventions, receptions and other gatherings. Under Section 18(1) of the Ordinance the Trust was empowered to do all things necessary or convenient to be done in connection with, or as incidental to, the performance of its functions. Section 18 (2a-2f) details particular powers of the Trust in relation to contracts, purchase, granting of rights to use the Theatre, admission charges, recording and broadcasting and provision of public facilities (restaurant etc). Under Section 30 of the Ordinance, the Trust was required to furnish the Minister such information relating to its operations as the Minister from time to time requires.

In 1989 ACT self-government came into effect.

Therefore on 3 September 1976 the Australian Art Exhibitions Corporation (AAEC) Limited was established as a company owned by the Australia Council. The AAEC, together with another organisation, the Australian GalleryDirector's Council, successfully managed several exhibitions including the El Dorado-Colombian Gold Exhibition (in 1978) and the Pompeii Exhibition (in 1980). Both agencies however, experienced financial difficulties and ultimately went into liquidation. In 1979 the Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon R.J. Ellicott, initiated the first moves towards establishing a Commonwealth organisation which would specialise in international exhibitions. On 16 May 1980 the first board of Directors of the International Cultural Corporation of Australia (ICCA) was appointed and held the inaugural meeting. The agency however, was formally incorporated on 24 June 1980. It was a Commonwealth-owned company registered in the Australian Capital Territory. The major aim of the Corporation is to bring to Australia significant international exhibitions and displays of art, antiquities and other items of artistic, cultural and historical interest. It also aims to send overseas the best of Australian art, antiquities and related items. The Corporation is entrepreneurial in its methods of operation and seeks sponsorship from the private sector. It offers its expertise and assistance to the Federal and State Governments and to museums and galleries. For the first four years of operation ICCA received a grant of $250,000 from the Australian Government. The agency's title changed to Art Exhibitions Australia Limited in March 1991. The charter of the company is to manage exhibitions and displays of art, antiquities and other cultural or historical material. The company functions as a self-funding, non-profit body governed by a Board of Directors who serve in an honorary capacity. The initial Chairman of the company was Mr James Leslie, Chairman and Managing Director of Mobil Oil Australia Ltd and the Board comprised as follows: Mr Norman Baker, Arthur Young and Co (Deputy Chairman) Dr Jean Battersby, CEO, Australia Council Mr Franco Belgiorno-Nettis, Managing Director, Transfield Group Mr Edmund Capon, Director, Art Gallery of NSW Ms Betty Churcher, Director, Australian National Gallery Mr Michael Darling, Managing Director, Clayton Robard Ltd Mr Robert Edwards, Director, Museum of Victoria (Chief Executive) Mrs Ann Lewis, Co-publisher of Xpress magazine Hon. Mr Justice John Lockhart, Judge of the Federal Court Mr Alan McGregor, grazier Mr Robert S. McKay Since its inception the following exhibitions have been arranged and managed by the Corporation: Aboriginal Art, Australian Pictorial Photography, Chinese Paintings of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, Fabulous Fashions 1907-1967, Australian Exhibition, Modern Commonwealth, Australian Heritage, Chinese Landscape Photography, Japan - Masterpieces from the Idemitsu Collection, Kandinsky Exhibition, Leonardo da Vinci Anatomical Drawings, Commonwealth Arts Festival; and Xian Exhibition, Terracotta Figures, China Records created by the Corporation include correspondence, financial documentation, newspaper clippings, catalogues, videocassettes and photographs. Exhibitions managed by ICCA (up to March 1991) were indemnified by the Commonwealth. The succeeding company, Art Exhibitions Australia Limited, was entered on the Register of Cultural Organisations established under Section 78(1)(a) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, listing bodies eligible to receive tax deductible donations. The company maintains close links with the Commonwealth arts portfolio and continues to receive indemnity on exhibitions.

According to press coverage and advertisements in July 1983, the Corporation was setting up a Secretariat group in Sydney in line with recommendations of the Dix Committee. The Secretariat was to research and develop policy options for the Board. The Corporation's functions include the provision of innovative and comprehensive broadcasting and television services of a high standard that involve broadcasting and television programs of an educational nature and that contribute to a sense of national identity, inform and entertain, and reflect the cultural diversity of the Australian Community. The Corporation's functions also include the transmission to countries outside Australia, of broadcasting and television programs of news, current affairs, entertainment and cultural enrichment; and the encouragement and promotion of the musical, dramatic and other performing arts in Australia. As part of its administration of these functions the ABC has an extensive network of television and radio broadcasting stations throughout Australia. The Corporation has Branch Offices in the State capitals, with Regional Offices in major regional centres. The ABC also has representation overseas and encompasses the operations of Radio Australia. The Corporation has power to do all things necessary or convenient to be done for, or in connection with, the performance of its functions and, in particular, to enter into contracts and to acquire, hold and dispose of real or personal property.

Items from Artbank's collection are available on lease for display in Commonwealth Government offices and other agencies in Australia and overseas.

This Committee meets regularly in State capital cities. As at 1980 it was intended to establish Selection Advisory Panels in the States.    The first Director of Artbank was Mr Graeme Sturgeon.

This Act changed the functions of the School, as originally established, by giving it responsibility for training in the areas of radio broadcasting and audio-visual communications. The name of the School was changed to Australian Film, Television and Radio School by the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, to properly reflect the functions of the school.  It retained its previous functions of education and training in film and television for both students and professionals, and the administration of financial grants. (1)  As part of the change in function the School established a Radio Unit which, in 1979, began by providing services and training to Aboriginal broadcasters. In 1981 the School installed a broadcast standard studio and began training for all sectors of radio broadcasting. At this time it also began a course in commercial radio techniques. (2)  Professor Jerzy Toeplitz who had been appointed director of the original Film and Television School (CA 1617) was replaced in 1980 by A.S. Walton. (3)  In 1985 (9 May) Walton was replaced by Ms Anne Deveson. (4)  The new Director instituted an examination of the School's activities which resulted in a report entitled \"New Directions Review\".  This review found gaps in the School's performance and recommended that the School: place greater emphasis on television training; increase training for aboriginals in the film, video, and television areas; increase the involvement of the School with industry; increase training in entrepreneurial skills; monitor technological developments in the industry; and introduced a new program to enable professionals to experiment. The main aim of the change in direction was to make the School more relevant to the professional needs of the industry and to reduce costs by increasing cooperation with other organisations. (5) The Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1986 changed the name of the School to the Australian Film, Television and Radio School.  In June 1986 work commenced on the School's first permanent home, a site within the grounds of Macquarie University, North Ryde.   Executive Minute No. 12 of 27 December 1991 approved changes to the administrative arrangements whereby the agency was placed from that date under the responsibility of the Minister for the newly created Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (CA 7431) (Commonwealth of Australia Gazette No. S 370 Friday, 27 December 1991).

From 23 October 1990 to 1 January 1992, the Institute was funded jointly by the Commonwealth and Australian Capital Territory  Government's.   In July 1989, an affiliation agreement was made between the Institute and the Australian National University (ANU).  As a result of this, discussions took place on the feasibility of amalgamation from the beginning of 1991.   The new arrangement was designed to achieve autonomy for the Institute, while giving students academic and administrative benefits by being aligned to a larger institution.  It would also preserve the relationship between the Institute and the Canberra community.   The amending legislation for the amalgamation was not ready by 1 January 1991.  Instead, amendments to the existing Australian National University Act were assented to by Parliament on 2 September 1991 and confirmed the establishment of an institute previously known as the Canberra Institute of the Arts within the University to take effect from 1 January 1992.    The Institute would be known as the Institute of the Arts and included the Canberra School of Music and the Canberra School of Art.   The amended Australian National University Act 1991, No. 131 of 1991, also repealed the Canberra Institute of the Arts Ordinance 1988.   The internal structure of the newly established Institute of the Arts remained as before except that it was now governed by a Board responsible to the Council of the University.   The University was given the power to employ staff, enrol students and grant a degree, diploma or certificate of the Institute of the Arts. The assets and liabilities of the Institute also became those of the University.

A National Broadcasting Symphony Orchestra participated in the opening night ABC program on July 1, 1932.  There was early intention by ABC management to set up a symphony orchestra in each State.  First use of the name Melbourne Symphony Orchestra was in 1906, this orchestra was founded by Alberto Zelman, junior.  During the period 1932 - 36 orchestras performing for an ABC concert were announced as, \"appearing under the auspices of\", \"in association with\", or by courtesy of\" the University of Melbourne.  This was in recognition of the fact that the University 'owned' the name but was prepared to allow the ABC to take over administrative control of the orchestra and use the name ABC (Melbourne) Symphony Orchestra.  The first year of a permanent ABC orchestra in Victoria was 1949.  This orchestra was called the Victorian Symphony Orchestra at the insistence of the Victorian Government.    It was not until 1965 when the name reverted to Melbourne Symphony Orchestra under the then Premier Sir Henry Bolte.  By 1957 the last of the State Symphony Orchestras had been set up.  Development of the ABC's six symphony orchestras has taken 25 years from the modest beginnings [1932].  The ABC was by then possibly the largest single comprehensive concert giving organisation in the world.

Under the Tasmanian Orchestra Agreement Act of 1948, the Tasmanian Government was authorised to enter into an agreement with the ABC for the establishment of an orchestra to be known as the Tasmanian Orchestra.  The agreement provided that the ABC establish the Tasmanian Orchestra as from March 1948.  During 1972 it was decided that it would be known in future as the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra (TSO) on all occasions.  The TSO is the smallest of the six ABC orchestras.  It entrepreneurs its own subscription series of concerts in Hobart and Launceston, tours Tasmanian regional centres, plays for visiting ballet companies, performs free outdoor concerts, has a comprehensive education program, and has received wide exposure via recordings, national broadcasts and television appearances.  The ABC is responsible for the management and control of the orchestra and also provides funding for a bulk of the operational costs with further funding provided from the Tasmanian Government, local councils and corporate sponsorship.  In 1985 the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Concert Music Department was formed incorporating the TSO.  As a result the TSO was given greater autonomy of management to be more responsible to local needs.

The Board consisted of four members, who were appointed to assist the Historic Memorials Committee (CA 290) in their decisions to commemorate and preserve \"for the public in oil or in stone, likenesses of prominent statesmen of Australia\". (2)   To this end, the Board, acting in an honorary capacity, advised the Committee in the matters of selecting the artists, choosing the types of memorials (i.e. paintings, sculptures etc.) and determining the payments for artists and artworks.   These duties were the primary functions of the Board, but in time it was also the Board's responsibility \"to advise the government in relation to the acquisition of works of art, exhibitions and art matters generally\". (3) The composition of the first Board was as follows: Hugh Paterson - Chairman G.V.F. Mann James Ashton D.S. Thistlethwayte   Hugh Paterson, the Chairman, was a personal friend of Andrew Fisher (later Prime Minister from 1908-1915 with short intervals) and brother of J. Ford Paterson, the artist.  Paterson himself was a successful business man in house painting and decorating and also a moderate artist.  It was Paterson who persuaded Fisher originally to do something to help Australian art and artists, resulting in the establishment of the Historic Memorials Committee in 1911 and the Art Advisory Board a year later.  Of the remaining three members, two were involved in artistic circles.  G.V.F. Mann, born in 1863, was an architect and a painter and Director of the National Art Gallery of New South Wales, when he was appointed to the Art Advisory Board.  James Ashton, born 1860, was an artist and teacher and Member of the Royal Society of Arts, as well as the Royal Drawing Society.  His son, Will Ashton became a well known artist and replaced his father as a member on the Art Advisory Board in 1918, an association that continued until 1961. (4)  Members continued to be chosen from the artistic milieu throughout the existence of the Board.  The Secretary, however, who also served as Secretary for the Historic Memorials Committee (CA 290), was a public servant, working in the Prime Minister's Department.  The first two secretaries - M.L. Shepherd (CP25) and P.E. Deane (CP78) - were both Secretaries to the Department of the Prime Minister and their primary duties were to the functioning of that Department.  The succeeding secretaries of the Board usually held public service positions at the Assistant Secretary level and were men with expertise in the cultural and welfare areas of the Prime Minister's Department.  At one stage the name of the Board changed with the addition \"Commonwealth\" to the title between (Aug.) 1958 and (Oct.) 1959.  The political changes of March 1971 and December 1972 led to administration reorganisations, which put the Board at various times under three different controlling Departments, eventually ending with the demise of the Board. Early correspondence and newspaper items in the records concerning both the Board and the Committee (held by Australian Archives) reveal that even before the formal establishment of the Art Advisory Board, advertisements were being placed in the Commonwealth Gazettes and letters written to various artists commissioning them to paint \"the pictures for the Commonwealth Gallery of Distinguished Australians\". (5)   Explicit instructions were issued to the chosen artists and those rules and regulations appeared to have been strictly adhered to. (6) In the early period of the Board's life, many Australian artists were working in Europe and it was decided to nominate a London representative, Dr Bertram Mackennal, ARA, of St John's Wood, London \"to act as the Art Advisory Board's representative in London in order to see that the commissions in the hands of such artists may be proceeded with in a satisfactory manner in terms of contract\". (7) In time the Board acquired additional responsibilities, such as the purchase of works of art, both early and modern Australian works as well as contemporary international art.  This is now housed in the Australian National Gallery in Canberra. The Board also organised and financed official Government exhibitions of Australian art overseas and contributed towards the cost of exhibitions from overseas in Australia. (8)  The Art Advisory Board came to an end on 16 February 1973, when a new policy for the arts was formulated by the Labour Government.  The Australian Council for the Arts [II] (CA 1615) came into being in February 1973, when the Labour Government announced their intention to establish the Australian Council for the Arts as a statutory authority.  This new Council was given the responsibility of preparing a report on the future shape and working arrangements for a continuing authority in the arts.  The basis of this Council was a number of boards each dealing with different areas of the arts.  Amongst the group to be established was the Visual and Plastic Arts Board  (9), also known as the Visual Arts Board, which assumed many of the functions of the Commonwealth Art Advisory Board, including advising the Historic Memorials Committee on the commissioning of portraits, but not those relating to acquisitions for the Australian National Gallery.

The Board was set up to promote, assist and co-ordinate the production, distribution and importation of films for the purpose of school and adult education; rehabilitation; social development; international understanding; trade and tourist extension and immigration.  Among the recommendations adopted by the full Cabinet were that the Board for administrative purposes should be attached to the Department of Information, and that Department would be the Commonwealth authority responsible for the production of films recommended by the Board. The Cabinet decision carried with it provision of funds for the purposes of the Board and the film work of the Department of Information.  The necessity of such a Board had been evident for many years. The Board had a domestic as well as an overseas publicity function. The technical facilities and the personnel of the Department of Information (including the Cinema Branch) were available to the board as a readily available trained nucleus.  The Board, which had been meeting very infrequently during the early 1970s, had its final meeting on 30 November 1972, the minutes being signed as a true record of the last meeting on  1 March 1973. The activities of the Board were then taken over by the Australian Film Development Corporation.

Hon. Harold Holt made a Ministerial statement in the House of Representative on Australian Cultural Activities in which he announced the establishment of an Australian Council.   He stated that \"the Council will co-operate closely with the Elizabethan Theatre Trust and with existing Commonwealth Government agencies responsible for music, painting and literature\" (Ibid): Mr Holt continued that Government financial assistance for the \"theatre Arts - drama, opera and ballet, and film-making for television with an educational and cultural emphasis\" would be channelled through the new Council for the Arts. The Council would also advise the Government on special requests for aid in cultural activities not already covered by Government agencies, and which, in the past, have been dealt with on an ad hoc basis (Ibid).   It was not however until 5 June 1968 that the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. John Gorton announced the names of the members of the Council. The Chairman was Dr. H.C Coombs, and the members Ms E. Archdale, Ms J. Bradley, W.P. Coleman MLA, Geoffrey Dutton, Ms G.D Erwin, Mr W.H. Houghton, B. Jones, Dr K. Langer and Professor K.C. Masterman (Sydney Morning Herald, 5 June 1972 p.11).  The Chairman of the Council was appointed for a period of five years and the nine members were representative of all States and the Australian Capital Territory. (Report of the Auditor-General, 1968-9, paragraph 207).   The appointment of Dr Jean Battersby as Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Council for the Arts was announced by Dr H.C. Coombs on 2 October 1968.  He said that Dr Battersby \"would be responsible to the Council for the organisation of studies of various aspects of the Arts and for the formulation for consideration by the Council, of Federal submissions to the Federal Government\".  (Sydney Morning Herald, 2 October 1968 p.2)   Commonwealth grants to the performing arts through the recommendations of the Australian Council for the Arts totalled $1,666,349 in 1968-9; $2,659,244 in 1969-70; $3,793,062 in 1970-1; $4,493,153 in 1971-2; and $5,733,643 in 1972-3. (Reports of the Auditor-General upon the Treasurer's statement of receipts and expenditure 1968-9, 1969-70, 1970-1, 1971-2, 1972-3).   The establishment of a new Council for the Arts was foreshadowed in November 1972 by the then Leader of the Opposition, E.G Whitlam when he announced the policies of the Labour Party for the arts.  He set out four broad objectives, namely to encourage excellence in the arts, to foster a wider spread of interest and participation, to help develop a national identity through artistic expression and to project Australia's image in other countries by means of the arts.  He proposed a statutory council devolving wide responsibilities on Boards for various art forms (Australian Council for the Arts, First Annual Report, January to December, 1973 p 9).   In January 1973 a new Council was established when the new Prime Minister the Rt. Hon. (E) Gough Whitlam announced a major reorganisation of Federal Government involvement in the arts.  He invited twenty-four people to form a new Council \"with a charter to ensure a continuity of support to existing recipients so that past government commitments might be honoured, to prepare a budget for the increased help which the Government had undertaken to provide and to prepare detailed plans for a Statutory Authority broadly based on the proposals outlined in the policy speech\" (Ibid).   In February 1973, the membership of the seven specialist constituent Boards was announced.  \"Approximately one third of the people appointed had been members of bodies advising the previous Government. All appointments were for one or two years. The intention was to keep things functioning while plans were developed for more lasting arrangements (Ibid). The Boards dealt respectively with Aboriginal arts, crafts, film and television, literature, music, theatre, and visual arts. Their membership varied from between eleven and fifteen people\".

The speech also proposed a statutory Council involving wide responsibilities on Boards for various art forms.

The membership of the Council included four categories of people. The majority were prominent artists and persons closely involved in the arts including the Chairmen of the various Boards. They were supported by others with legal, financial and other administrative skills, with however, a known interest in the arts, and by several senior officials of government departments and agencies whose work interlocked with that of the council.   The council met for the first time on 16 February 1973 and rapidly assembled a draft report which was tabled in Parliament by the Prime Minister on 24 May 1973 on the shape and working arrangements for a continuing authority in the arts.  After considerable debate on the issues raised in the above report a final version was sent to the Prime Minister and approved by Cabinet in November 1973.

The School was set up as the national training facility for film and television professionals.  The functions of the School, as outlined in the Act, were to: provide education and training; conduct and encourage research; conduct seminars and other such courses for professionals; co-operate with other television bodies with respect to program production; offer facilities to professionals for the purposes of program production; make grants of financial assistance; and award degrees, diplomas, and certificates in relation to the educational courses offered by the school. The Act further stated that the \"School shall exercise its functions with a view to enabling and encouraging the production of films and television programs of a high degree of creativeness and of high technical and artistic standards\". (2)  Under the Act the School was to be governed by a body to be known as the Council of the Film and Television School. The Council consisted of the Director of the School, two members of the staff of the School elected by the staff, two students of the School elected by the student body, and five members appointed by the Governor-General. (3)  The first Council of the School consisted of:  Chairman: Barry Jones, MLA Members: J. Bailey          H. Crawford          J. Flaus          G. Healy          J. Long (Deputy Chairman)          R.K. Mason          J.H.M. Oswin          B. Robinson          P. Weir  The first Director of the School was Professor Jerzy Toeplitz, formerly of Poland's National Film School and the first Assistant Director was John Martin-Jones.  The School offered its first courses in 1973. Two courses were offered: the full-time program for full time students, usually not experienced in the industry, and the open program for professionals in the film and television area. The School also administered, from its first year of operation, various grants-in-aid to enable suitably qualified people to benefit from study, experience, or training in Australia or overseas. (5)  The School began its operations at 2 Help Street, Chatswood, the former offices of the Interim Council of the School. Land was acquired at North Ryde and by April 1975 the School was able to move from Chatswood and hold its courses at North Ryde.  On 29 October 1976 the Film and Television Act was amended by the insertion of the word 'Australian' before 'Film', and by the addition to the School's functions of responsibility for training and education in the areas of radio broadcasting and audio-visual communications.

(c) to provide financial assistance to producers of Australian films     under arrangements that entitle the Corporation to receive a     share of the proceeds derived from the sale, hire or exhibition     of the films or, the inclusion of the films in television     programmes but do not render the Corporation liable for any debts     incurred by those producers; and   (d) subject to the approval of the Minister, to form, or participate     with another person in the formation of a company for the purpose     of carrying on business, of the distribution of Australian films     and to acquire, hold and dispose of shares or stock in the     capital of a company carrying on such a business.   By Section 18 one million dollars was appropriated for the Corporation.   Under Section 6 the Corporation was to consist of a Chairman and four other members appointed by the Governor-General, and under Section 22 there was also to be an Executive Officer to manage the affairs of the Corporation.   This Act was assented to on 17 June 1970 and the Corporation was established by Proclamation on 17 August 1970 (Commonwealth Gazette, 17 August 1970, p 5687).   The Board of the Corporation, announced by the Prime Minister the Rt Hon John Gorton on 17 August 1970 was:  Chairman J Darling, and members D E Brown, MBE, T S Duckmanton, CBE, R S Elliott and Barry Jones. (The Australian, 18 August 1970, p 2).   By April 1974 the Corporation was providing money to the Australian film industry at an average of $130,000 per month and had been involved in the production of both feature films and films for television.  The feature films include \"Alvin Purple\", \"The Adventures of Barry McKenzie\", \"The Cars That Ate Paris\", \"Petersen\", and \"Between Wars\".   The Corporation had also helped finance the T.V documentaries 'Wild Country'- Channel 7 and 'Poisoned Dart'- Channel 10, and has provided assistance for television series including 'Ryan', 'Homicide', 'Boney', 'Silent Number', and 'Seven Little Australians'. (Department of the Media, A Review of Activities, April 1974, pp 43-47).   In a press statement on 10 December 1973, the Minister for the Media, Senator the Hon Douglas McClelland, in announcing the proposed legislation to establish an Australian Film Commission stated that the Commission would replace the Australian Film Development Corporation which would be disbanded.  (Sydney Morning Herald, 13 February 1974, p 22).   On 28 September 1974 the Australian Film Commission Bill 1974 was presented to Parliament but was rejected by the Senate on 3 December 1974. The Australian Film Commission Act was finally assented to on 7 March 1975.   However, under the terms of the Act, the Australian Film Development Corporation Act 1970 and the Australian Film Development Corporation Act (No 2) 1970, continued to be extant, as Part VI of the Act covering the repeal of these acts had to be proclaimed separately. Part VI was proclaimed on 8 July 1975 and from that date \"all rights property and assets (including the moneys standing to the credit of the Australian Film Development Fund) that immediately before [..date of proclamation..] were vested in the Australian Film Development Corporation, [were] ... vested in the Commission\".

Cabinet agreed that an independent statutory body as recommended by the Tariff Board be established, but that the structure and membership should be a matter for further consideration between the Minister for the Media, The Treasurer and The Public Service Board. It authorised Senator McClelland to proceed with the establishment of an interim board of the Australian Film Commission so work may be commenced in the planning stages. (The Media, A collection of speeches made by the Minister for the Media, Senator The Honourable Douglas McClelland during the period 16 June - 10 December 1973, Appendix 2).

Members were Messrs. J. Darling (Chairman), R. Elliott, L. Beioley, G. Burke, H. Crawford, J. McQuaid, J. Oswin, S. Walton, R. Whitbread, Sir Keith Waller and Joan Long. The first meeting was held on 27 February 1974, and the Broadcasting and Film Division of the Department of the Media was given the responsibility of preparing more than 50 briefing papers for the Interim Board to assist its consideration of matters associated with the establishment and operation of the Australian Film Commission (Department of the Media, Report for 1 July 1973 - 30 June 1974 p. 8).  On 26 September 1974 the Australian Film Commission Bill 1974 was presented to Parliament but was rejected by the Senate on 3 December, 1974. The Bill was presented again in early 1975 and was assented to on 7 March 1975.

The Act also gave the Commission the powers previously exercised by the Australian Film Development Corporation (CA 1666), although these functions were not taken over until 8 July 1975 when Part VI of the Australian Film Commission which repealed the Australian Film Development Corporation Act was proclaimed. In April 1975 considerable controversy in the Australian film industry surrounded a letter written by the then Minister for the Media Senator Douglas McClelland inviting Mr Jack Valenti, President of the Motion Picture Association of America to suggest names of people suitable for the board of the newly-formed Commission. Following the nature of this letter becoming public knowledge the Minister compiled a list of Australian nominees recommended for appointment to the Film Commission (Sydney Morning Herald 14 April 1975 p. 3) On 15 April 1975 Senator McClelland announced the membership of the Commission. Initial appointments to the Commission consisted of four full-time and four part-time members whose appointments dated from 5 May 1975: Full-time Members: Mr K.

Mr A A Tregear was Secretary of the Commission and Mr T C Pittaway was Assistant Secretary.   The Commission was to \"inquire into and report on the moving picture industry in Australia and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to inquire particularly into:   1. the importation, production, distribution and exhibition of moving    picture films;   2. the incidence and effect of the customs tariff upon the    importation of such films and the sufficiency or otherwise of    existing duties of customs;   3. the sufficiency or otherwise of the existing income tax law of the    Commonwealth in relation to persons, firms and companies engaged    in the industry; and   4. the connection with any and all of the foregoing matters, the    income, profits, expenditure and losses of such persons, firms and    companies derived from or incurred in connection with the    industry, and the amount of capital invested in the industry.\"   Evidence was taken in all the capital cities of Australia and in certain states where local problems of distribution and exhibition warranted it. 147 sittings were held and 253 witnesses were examined, evidence being taken in camera where necessary.   The four divisions of the motion picture industry were dealt with separately; namely the importation, distribution, exhibition and production of films.   The fifty recommendations of the Commission included:   . that a Board of Film Censors should be established consisting of   two men and a woman;   . that there should also be a Censorship Board of Appeal consisting   of five members, on which the motion picture industry would not be   represented;   . all film distributors in Australia should be registered and   contracts for distribution limited to 12 months;   . all motion picture exhibitors should be registered and the films   screened by them subject to the Commonwealth Censorship Board;    . the Appeal Board should issue Awards for Merit for the   encouragement of film production in Australia;   . a quota system should be introduced ensuring an increasing   percentage of Empire produced feature films, 5 in the first year   increasing to 15 in the third year;   . films shown in Mandated Territories should be passed by the   Censorship Board as suitable for that specific exhibition;   . films should be graded by the Censorship Board as \"suitable for   Universal Exhibition\" and \"For Adults Only\" with those shown at   matinees for children being only of the former type;   . educational films in the States should be assisted in every way by   the Commonwealth;   . taxation of gross earnings remitted to America by Australian Branch   companies should be reconsidered;   . British agencies should be established for the distribution of   their own films; and   . customs tariffs on British films should be continued with   reciprocal tariff preference for Australian films entering Britain   and other parts of the Empire.

The first meeting was held in Sydney on 23 September 1932 and J H Keating appeared as Counsel to assist the Commission and represent the public. Many companies were represented at this meeting and at subsequent meetings further associations, societies and bodies were represented, members of the public supplied information and gave evidence also. There were 67 sittings, 60 witnesses gave evidence and 169 exhibits were produced.   The Australasian Performing Rights Association Ltd which was incorporated on 4 January 1926 had a close association with the Performing Rights Society (Britain) in that this Society had a representative on the Board of Directors of the Australian Association, neither was profit making. In his Report the Commissioner commended the Association for its organisation and methods of distributing moneys to authors, composers, publishers and others. However, the super-monopoly of the Association in controlling over 80% of the best music which was subject to copyright meant that it controlled the music performed in public and dictated its own terms.   The Commissioner recommended that there should be a Tribunal to determine disputes arising out of the performances in public of musical works and for the use of records in public; that the Australasian Performing Rights Association should compile from time to time a list of musical works requiring licence; that there should be regular filing of accounts of the receipts and distribution of fees collected by the Australasian Performing Rights Association probably at the nearest Copyright Office; that no fees should be paid for relay broadcasting provided the initial fee had been paid and no charges made where the performance was not directly for private profit or was for religious, educational or charitable purposes.   The Report was signed on 24 April 1933, presented by Command and ordered to be printed on 24 May 1933.

The idea of such festival held in Canberra had been mooted as early as 1968 by the Canberra Theatre Trust. A group of people were brought together within the Department of the Capital Territory to make preparations for the Festival planed for March 1975. The Ordinance governing the Activities of Festival Australia was drawn up in the Department of the Capital Territory, and by the Ordinance the Board of Governors was appointed.(1)  A number of committees were also set up by the Ordinance Schedule. They were:   Programme - Arts Committee, Programme - Science Committee, Finance Committee, Public Relations Committee, Community Participation Committee. (2)   The Minister of State for the Department of the Capital Territory was to be the Chairman of the Board of Governors. The City Manager (from the Department of the Capital Territory) was to be Deputy Chairman. The Board members were people of substantial standing in the fields of the arts and science.   The Festival Australia body was incorporated to organise and raise funds for a national festival of the creative arts and sciences. It was empowered 'to promote and encourage Australia arts, science and technology'(3) by organising exhibitions, festival (music, drama, films and so forth), lectures and other performances in the fields of the arts and sciences in suitable venues in Canberra. It was therefore enabled to employ persons, to engage venues and raise funds for the purpose of holding festivals.     In the Constitutions of Festival Australia sixteen objects and powers were outlined. The major objects and powers were described as:   \"(a) to promote and encourage Australian arts, science and technology and for these purpose to organise, promote manage and conduct festivals of music drama and other entertainments and exhibitions, demonstrations, expositions, lectures and other activities in Canberra or elsewhere annually or at such intervals as Festival Australia may determine;   (b) to present, produce, manage and conduct at theatres, halls galleries, cinemas, lecture theatres and other premises and open spaces activities such as operas, plays, dramas, ballets, concerts, recitals, exhibitions, readings, demonstrations, expositions, lectures, cinematographic performances and other entertainments or activities as may tend to promote and encourage Australian arts, science and technology;   (c) to engage, and employ persons and bodies corporate to produce and present such operas, plays, dramas, ballets, concerts, recitals, exhibitions, readings, demonstrations, expositions, lectures, cinematographic performances and other entertainments or activities as may tend to promote and encourage Australian arts, science and technology;   (d) to engage  employ or sponsor persons and bodies corporate to conduct or engage in research or any other activities as may tend to promote and encourage Australian arts, science or technology,   (e) to make and carry out ... arrangements... for the presentation of operas, plays, dramas, ballets, concerts, recitals, exhibitions, reading, demonstrations [etc] as may tend to promote and encourage Australian arts, science or technology..;   (f) to engage in the sale and distribution of admission tickets to entertainment or instruction conducted by or on behalf of Festival Australia;   (h) to establish such courses of study, and award such scholarships, as will enable the objects of Festival Australia to be best attained;   (i) to provide and maintain such libraries and a associated facilities as are necessary or desirable for carrying out the objects of Festival Australia;   (j) to raise money for the purpose of Festival Australia....,   (k) to invest the funds of Festival Australia or under its charge and not immediately required upon such securities or investments as the Board may from time to time determine;   (l) to undertake and execute any trusts the undertaking where or may be incidental to the attainment of the objects of Festival Australia or any of them;   (m) to establish and support and aid in the establishment and support of any associations or institutions which have for their objects the promotions, or encouragement of Australia arts, science or technology on the study of the arts, science or technology   (n) to provide meeting places, clubs and other social amenities in connection with festivals organised or promoted by Festival Australia.   (o) to acquire, hold, purchase, lease, sell, exchange, mortgage and dispose of any form of property real or personal for the purposes of Festival Australia.(4)   The original intention was that such a national festival should be held biennially, but after the first festival, Australia,'75, it was decided that this was not economically feasible.   The original Board consisted of:   Margot Anthony, Arthur Birch, John Bruce, Rupert Cater, Penelope Chapman; Michael Edgley; the Hon. Russell Fox; Lady Heydon; Ross Hohnen; L. Engledow; Arthur Kenyon; Richard Kingsland; Leonie Kramer; David Purnell.   The Secretarial staff was drawn primarily from the Department of the Capital Territory, which also provided office accommodation. The main records created by Festival Australia were the minutes of the Board's and of the Committee's meetings and correspondence, handled by the Secretariat.   By ordinance No. 34 of 1978 the Government dissolved the current Board of Governors which had last been amended by Ordinance No. 14 of 1976. Whilst ordinance No 34 did not dissolve the corporation itself, it virtually suspended the Board's activities by not making any new appointments  In future appointment would be made by instrument in writing by the Minister of State for the Capital Territory and would consist of the following:-   2 officers or employees of the Department of the Capital Territory; 1 officer or employee of the Department of the Prime Minister and      Cabinet; 1 officer or employee of the Department of Finance; 1 member of the Legislative Assembly; The Minister of State for the Capital Territory   The ordinance also stated that the rights, privileges, obligations and liabilities of the Corporation immediately before 26 October 1978 should be rested in the Commonwealth, and that the Commonwealth should also be substituted for the Corporation in any legal proceedings.(5)   As this ordinance only suspended the activities of the Board and did not abolish the organisation itself, the closing date of the date range of this agency had been taken as 1979, the year in which Festival Australia Inc. is no longer listed in the Commonwealth Directory as an organisation for which the Minister for the Capital Territory is responsible.   This information was drawn primarily from the Australian Government Directory. 1974 and  1979; from the Festival Australia Incorporation Ordinance 1973, from the records created by Festival Australia; and from Mr W.E Lawrence, present member of the Board of Governors.

The Ordinance was gazetted on 21 June 1965 (1) and trustees were appointed on 22 June. (2) Under Section 4(2) of the Ordinance the Trust was established as a body corporate, with a common seal, the ability to acquire, hold and dispose of real and personal property and the ability to sue or be sued in its corporate name. Under Section 4(3) of the ordinance all courts, judges and persons acting judicially were required to take judicial notice of the common seal of the trust affixed to a document and to assume that it was duly affixed. Under Section 17 of the Ordinance, the functions of the Trust were stated as being: a) to occupy the Canberra Theatre Centre, and to use and manage it as a concert hall, theatre and place of assembly for the presentation of artistic and cultural entertainments displays and exhibitions and other forms of entertainment and instruction; b) to promote and encourage the development and presentation of the arts; c) to promote and encourage public interest and participation in, and appreciation of, the arts; c) to the extent that the Canberra Theatre Centre is not required for the purposes of the performance of the foregoing functions, to make it available for public and other meetings, and for conventions, receptions and other gatherings. Under Section 18(1) of the Ordinance the Trust was empowered to do all things necessary or convenient to be done in connection with, or as incidental to, the performance of its functions. Section 18 (2a-2f) details particular powers of the Trust in relation to contracts, purchase, granting of rights to use the Theatre, admission charges, recording and broadcasting and provision of public facilities (restaurant etc). Under Section 30 of the Ordinance, the Trust was required to furnish the Minister such information relating to its operations as the Minister from time to time requires. Under Section 32 (1) of the Ordinance, the trust was required, as soon as practicable after each thirteenth day of June, to furnish to the Minister a report of its operations during the year ended on that date, together with financial statements, in such form as the Minister of State for finance approves, in respect of that year. Under Section 6 and Section 7 of the Ordinance the Trust was to be constituted by a Chairman, a Deputy Chairman and seven other trustees. All trustees were to be appointed by the Minister for the Interior [II] (and later for the Capital Territory). Six trustees constituted a quorum, voting being decided by a majority of votes. The first trustees were: Leslie Bruce Hamilton, Stefan Haag, John Casson, Ian Maclean, Hector William Crawford, Clement William Semmler, Arthur Thomas Shakespeare, George Alexander Currie and Richard Kingsland. These were appointed for a period of one year, however, Section 6(2) of the Ordinance states that the Minister may appoint trustees for a period not exceeding five years. Under Section 22 of the Ordinance the Trust may employ such persons as it thinks necessary, the terms and conditions (including remuneration) of such employment to be determined by the Trust, subject to any directions of the Minister.

Therefore on 3 September 1976 the Australian Art Exhibitions Corporation (AAEC) Limited was established as a company owned by the Australia Council. The AAEC, together with another organisation, the Australian GalleryDirector's Council, successfully managed several exhibitions including the El Dorado-Colombian Gold Exhibition (in 1978) and the Pompeii Exhibition (in 1980). Both agencies however, experienced financial difficulties and ultimately went into liquidation. In 1979 the Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon R.J. Ellicott, initiated the first moves towards establishing a Commonwealth organisation which would specialise in international exhibitions. On 16 May 1980 the first board of Directors of the International Cultural Corporation of Australia (ICCA) was appointed and held the inaugural meeting. The agency however, was formally incorporated on 24 June 1980. It was a Commonwealth-owned company registered in the Australian Capital Territory. The major aim of the Corporation is to bring to Australia significant international exhibitions and displays of art, antiquities and other items of artistic, cultural and historical interest. It also aims to send overseas the best of Australian art, antiquities and related items. The Corporation is entrepreneurial in its methods of operation and seeks sponsorship from the private sector. It offers its expertise and assistance to the Federal and State Governments and to museums and galleries. For the first four years of operation ICCA received a grant of $250,000 from the Australian Government. The agency's title changed to Art Exhibitions Australia Limited in March 1991. The charter of the company is to manage exhibitions and displays of art, antiquities and other cultural or historical material. The company functions as a self-funding, non-profit body governed by a Board of Directors who serve in an honorary capacity. The initial Chairman of the company was Mr James Leslie, Chairman and Managing Director of Mobil Oil Australia Ltd and the Board comprised as follows: Mr Norman Baker, Arthur Young and Co (Deputy Chairman) Dr Jean Battersby, CEO, Australia Council Mr Franco Belgiorno-Nettis, Managing Director, Transfield Group Mr Edmund Capon, Director, Art Gallery of NSW Ms Betty Churcher, Director, Australian National Gallery Mr Michael Darling, Managing Director, Clayton Robard Ltd Mr Robert Edwards, Director, Museum of Victoria (Chief Executive) Mrs Ann Lewis, Co-publisher of Xpress magazine Hon. Mr Justice John Lockhart, Judge of the Federal Court Mr Alan McGregor, grazier Mr Robert S. McKay Since its inception the following exhibitions have been arranged and managed by the Corporation: Aboriginal Art, Australian Pictorial Photography, Chinese Paintings of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, Fabulous Fashions 1907-1967, Australian Exhibition, Modern Commonwealth, Australian Heritage, Chinese Landscape Photography, Japan - Masterpieces from the Idemitsu Collection, Kandinsky Exhibition, Leonardo da Vinci Anatomical Drawings, Commonwealth Arts Festival; and Xian Exhibition, Terracotta Figures, China Records created by the Corporation include correspondence, financial documentation, newspaper clippings, catalogues, videocassettes and photographs. Exhibitions managed by ICCA (up to March 1991) were indemnified by the Commonwealth. The succeeding company, Art Exhibitions Australia Limited, was entered on the Register of Cultural Organisations established under Section 78(1)(a) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, listing bodies eligible to receive tax deductible donations. The company maintains close links with the Commonwealth arts portfolio and continues to receive indemnity on exhibitions.

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 provides the Corporation with a seal, a Board of Directors, a Managing Director, an Advisory Council and State, Territory and regional Advisory Councils. In addition, the Board may establish advisory committees. According to press coverage and advertisements in July 1983, the Corporation was setting up a Secretariat group in Sydney in line with recommendations of the Dix Committee. The Secretariat was to research and develop policy options for the Board. The Corporation's functions include the provision of innovative and comprehensive broadcasting and television services of a high standard that involve broadcasting and television programs of an educational nature and that contribute to a sense of national identity, inform and entertain, and reflect the cultural diversity of the Australian Community. The Corporation's functions also include the transmission to countries outside Australia, of broadcasting and television programs of news, current affairs, entertainment and cultural enrichment; and the encouragement and promotion of the musical, dramatic and other performing arts in Australia. As part of its administration of these functions the ABC has an extensive network of television and radio broadcasting stations throughout Australia. The Corporation has Branch Offices in the State capitals, with Regional Offices in major regional centres. The ABC also has representation overseas and encompasses the operations of Radio Australia. The Corporation has power to do all things necessary or convenient to be done for, or in connection with, the performance of its functions and, in particular, to enter into contracts and to acquire, hold and dispose of real or personal property. The Corporation does not have power to borrow moneys.

Items from Artbank's collection are available on lease for display in Commonwealth Government offices and other agencies in Australia and overseas. Clients are encouraged to place these works wherever large numbers of people meet, eg reception areas, foyers, etc. In this way they are enabling more Australians to become familiar with the works of their contemporaries.   Artbank's Acquisitions Advisory Committee chooses works of art from items submitted by the Director. These works can then be leased for an annual rental fee of 12% of their current market value. This Committee meets regularly in State capital cities. As at 1980 it was intended to establish Selection Advisory Panels in the States.    The first Director of Artbank was Mr Graeme Sturgeon. The first Board of Artbank was Mr Richard Crebbin, Ms Sue Walker, Mr Kenneth Jack and Mr Carl Andrew.

This Act changed the functions of the School, as originally established, by giving it responsibility for training in the areas of radio broadcasting and audio-visual communications. The name of the School was changed to Australian Film, Television and Radio School by the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, to properly reflect the functions of the school.  It retained its previous functions of education and training in film and television for both students and professionals, and the administration of financial grants. (1)  As part of the change in function the School established a Radio Unit which, in 1979, began by providing services and training to Aboriginal broadcasters. In 1981 the School installed a broadcast standard studio and began training for all sectors of radio broadcasting. At this time it also began a course in commercial radio techniques. (2)  Professor Jerzy Toeplitz who had been appointed director of the original Film and Television School (CA 1617) was replaced in 1980 by A.S. Walton. (3)  In 1985 (9 May) Walton was replaced by Ms Anne Deveson. (4)  The new Director instituted an examination of the School's activities which resulted in a report entitled \"New Directions Review\".  This review found gaps in the School's performance and recommended that the School: place greater emphasis on television training; increase training for aboriginals in the film, video, and television areas; increase the involvement of the School with industry; increase training in entrepreneurial skills; monitor technological developments in the industry; and introduced a new program to enable professionals to experiment. The main aim of the change in direction was to make the School more relevant to the professional needs of the industry and to reduce costs by increasing cooperation with other organisations. (5) The Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1986 changed the name of the School to the Australian Film, Television and Radio School.  In June 1986 work commenced on the School's first permanent home, a site within the grounds of Macquarie University, North Ryde.   Executive Minute No. 12 of 27 December 1991 approved changes to the administrative arrangements whereby the agency was placed from that date under the responsibility of the Minister for the newly created Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (CA 7431) (Commonwealth of Australia Gazette No. S 370 Friday, 27 December 1991).

The functions of the Institute are:   (a) to conduct in the Australian Capital Territory, an     educational institution for the purpose of fostering the     achievement of excellence in the study, at tertiary and other     levels, of -                        (i) music;           (ii) visual arts and crafts; and          (iii) such other fields of the arts as the Board, with the                 approval of the Minister determines or the Minister                requires.   (b) to provide courses and programs, and to use the facilities     and resources of the Institute, to advance and develop knowledge     and skills;   (c) to promote the development of community awareness and     appreciation of the arts;   (d) to award degrees, diplomas and certificates in accordance with     the statutes;   (e) to consult and co-operate with other institutions and with         persons, associations, organisations and authorities, concerned     with the provision of education and training in the arts; and   (f) to do anything incidental to any of the foregoing.     From 23 October 1990 to 1 January 1992, the Institute was funded jointly by the Commonwealth and Australian Capital Territory  Government's.   In July 1989, an affiliation agreement was made between the Institute and the Australian National University (ANU).  As a result of this, discussions took place on the feasibility of amalgamation from the beginning of 1991.   The new arrangement was designed to achieve autonomy for the Institute, while giving students academic and administrative benefits by being aligned to a larger institution.  It would also preserve the relationship between the Institute and the Canberra community.   The amending legislation for the amalgamation was not ready by 1 January 1991.  Instead, amendments to the existing Australian National University Act were assented to by Parliament on 2 September 1991 and confirmed the establishment of an institute previously known as the Canberra Institute of the Arts within the University to take effect from 1 January 1992.    The Institute would be known as the Institute of the Arts and included the Canberra School of Music and the Canberra School of Art.   The amended Australian National University Act 1991, No. 131 of 1991, also repealed the Canberra Institute of the Arts Ordinance 1988.   The internal structure of the newly established Institute of the Arts remained as before except that it was now governed by a Board responsible to the Council of the University.   The University was given the power to employ staff, enrol students and grant a degree, diploma or certificate of the Institute of the Arts. The assets and liabilities of the Institute also became those of the University.

A National Broadcasting Symphony Orchestra participated in the opening night ABC program on July 1, 1932.  There was early intention by ABC management to set up a symphony orchestra in each State.  First use of the name Melbourne Symphony Orchestra was in 1906, this orchestra was founded by Alberto Zelman, junior.  During the period 1932 - 36 orchestras performing for an ABC concert were announced as, \"appearing under the auspices of\", \"in association with\", or by courtesy of\" the University of Melbourne.  This was in recognition of the fact that the University 'owned' the name but was prepared to allow the ABC to take over administrative control of the orchestra and use the name ABC (Melbourne) Symphony Orchestra.  The first year of a permanent ABC orchestra in Victoria was 1949.  This orchestra was called the Victorian Symphony Orchestra at the insistence of the Victorian Government.    It was not until 1965 when the name reverted to Melbourne Symphony Orchestra under the then Premier Sir Henry Bolte.  By 1957 the last of the State Symphony Orchestras had been set up.  Development of the ABC's six symphony orchestras has taken 25 years from the modest beginnings [1932].  The ABC was by then possibly the largest single comprehensive concert giving organisation in the world.

Under the Tasmanian Orchestra Agreement Act of 1948, the Tasmanian Government was authorised to enter into an agreement with the ABC for the establishment of an orchestra to be known as the Tasmanian Orchestra.  The agreement provided that the ABC establish the Tasmanian Orchestra as from March 1948.  During 1972 it was decided that it would be known in future as the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra (TSO) on all occasions.  The TSO is the smallest of the six ABC orchestras.  It entrepreneurs its own subscription series of concerts in Hobart and Launceston, tours Tasmanian regional centres, plays for visiting ballet companies, performs free outdoor concerts, has a comprehensive education program, and has received wide exposure via recordings, national broadcasts and television appearances.  The ABC is responsible for the management and control of the orchestra and also provides funding for a bulk of the operational costs with further funding provided from the Tasmanian Government, local councils and corporate sponsorship.  In 1985 the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Concert Music Department was formed incorporating the TSO.  As a result the TSO was given greater autonomy of management to be more responsible to local needs.

The Board consisted of four members, who were appointed to assist the Historic Memorials Committee (CA 290) in their decisions to commemorate and preserve \"for the public in oil or in stone, likenesses of prominent statesmen of Australia\". (2)   To this end, the Board, acting in an honorary capacity, advised the Committee in the matters of selecting the artists, choosing the types of memorials (i.e. paintings, sculptures etc.) and determining the payments for artists and artworks.   These duties were the primary functions of the Board, but in time it was also the Board's responsibility \"to advise the government in relation to the acquisition of works of art, exhibitions and art matters generally\". (3) The composition of the first Board was as follows: Hugh Paterson - Chairman G.V.F. Mann James Ashton D.S. Thistlethwayte   Hugh Paterson, the Chairman, was a personal friend of Andrew Fisher (later Prime Minister from 1908-1915 with short intervals) and brother of J. Ford Paterson, the artist.  Paterson himself was a successful business man in house painting and decorating and also a moderate artist.  It was Paterson who persuaded Fisher originally to do something to help Australian art and artists, resulting in the establishment of the Historic Memorials Committee in 1911 and the Art Advisory Board a year later.  Of the remaining three members, two were involved in artistic circles.  G.V.F. Mann, born in 1863, was an architect and a painter and Director of the National Art Gallery of New South Wales, when he was appointed to the Art Advisory Board.  James Ashton, born 1860, was an artist and teacher and Member of the Royal Society of Arts, as well as the Royal Drawing Society.  His son, Will Ashton became a well known artist and replaced his father as a member on the Art Advisory Board in 1918, an association that continued until 1961. (4)  Members continued to be chosen from the artistic milieu throughout the existence of the Board.  The Secretary, however, who also served as Secretary for the Historic Memorials Committee (CA 290), was a public servant, working in the Prime Minister's Department.  The first two secretaries - M.L. Shepherd (CP25) and P.E. Deane (CP78) - were both Secretaries to the Department of the Prime Minister and their primary duties were to the functioning of that Department.  The succeeding secretaries of the Board usually held public service positions at the Assistant Secretary level and were men with expertise in the cultural and welfare areas of the Prime Minister's Department.  At one stage the name of the Board changed with the addition \"Commonwealth\" to the title between (Aug.) 1958 and (Oct.) 1959.  The political changes of March 1971 and December 1972 led to administration reorganisations, which put the Board at various times under three different controlling Departments, eventually ending with the demise of the Board. Early correspondence and newspaper items in the records concerning both the Board and the Committee (held by Australian Archives) reveal that even before the formal establishment of the Art Advisory Board, advertisements were being placed in the Commonwealth Gazettes and letters written to various artists commissioning them to paint \"the pictures for the Commonwealth Gallery of Distinguished Australians\". (5)   Explicit instructions were issued to the chosen artists and those rules and regulations appeared to have been strictly adhered to. (6) In the early period of the Board's life, many Australian artists were working in Europe and it was decided to nominate a London representative, Dr Bertram Mackennal, ARA, of St John's Wood, London \"to act as the Art Advisory Board's representative in London in order to see that the commissions in the hands of such artists may be proceeded with in a satisfactory manner in terms of contract\". (7) In time the Board acquired additional responsibilities, such as the purchase of works of art, both early and modern Australian works as well as contemporary international art.  This is now housed in the Australian National Gallery in Canberra. The Board also organised and financed official Government exhibitions of Australian art overseas and contributed towards the cost of exhibitions from overseas in Australia. (8)  The Art Advisory Board came to an end on 16 February 1973, when a new policy for the arts was formulated by the Labour Government.  The Australian Council for the Arts [II] (CA 1615) came into being in February 1973, when the Labour Government announced their intention to establish the Australian Council for the Arts as a statutory authority.  This new Council was given the responsibility of preparing a report on the future shape and working arrangements for a continuing authority in the arts.  The basis of this Council was a number of boards each dealing with different areas of the arts.  Amongst the group to be established was the Visual and Plastic Arts Board  (9), also known as the Visual Arts Board, which assumed many of the functions of the Commonwealth Art Advisory Board, including advising the Historic Memorials Committee on the commissioning of portraits, but not those relating to acquisitions for the Australian National Gallery.

The Board was set up to promote, assist and co-ordinate the production, distribution and importation of films for the purpose of school and adult education; rehabilitation; social development; international understanding; trade and tourist extension and immigration.  Among the recommendations adopted by the full Cabinet were that the Board for administrative purposes should be attached to the Department of Information, and that Department would be the Commonwealth authority responsible for the production of films recommended by the Board. The Cabinet decision carried with it provision of funds for the purposes of the Board and the film work of the Department of Information.  The necessity of such a Board had been evident for many years. The Board had a domestic as well as an overseas publicity function. The technical facilities and the personnel of the Department of Information (including the Cinema Branch) were available to the board as a readily available trained nucleus.  The Board, which had been meeting very infrequently during the early 1970s, had its final meeting on 30 November 1972, the minutes being signed as a true record of the last meeting on  1 March 1973. The activities of the Board were then taken over by the Australian Film Development Corporation.

Hon. Harold Holt made a Ministerial statement in the House of Representative on Australian Cultural Activities in which he announced the establishment of an Australian Council.   He stated that \"the Council will co-operate closely with the Elizabethan Theatre Trust and with existing Commonwealth Government agencies responsible for music, painting and literature\" (Ibid): Mr Holt continued that Government financial assistance for the \"theatre Arts - drama, opera and ballet, and film-making for television with an educational and cultural emphasis\" would be channelled through the new Council for the Arts. The Council would also advise the Government on special requests for aid in cultural activities not already covered by Government agencies, and which, in the past, have been dealt with on an ad hoc basis (Ibid).   It was not however until 5 June 1968 that the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. John Gorton announced the names of the members of the Council. The Chairman was Dr. H.C Coombs, and the members Ms E. Archdale, Ms J. Bradley, W.P. Coleman MLA, Geoffrey Dutton, Ms G.D Erwin, Mr W.H. Houghton, B. Jones, Dr K. Langer and Professor K.C. Masterman (Sydney Morning Herald, 5 June 1972 p.11).  The Chairman of the Council was appointed for a period of five years and the nine members were representative of all States and the Australian Capital Territory. (Report of the Auditor-General, 1968-9, paragraph 207).   The appointment of Dr Jean Battersby as Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Council for the Arts was announced by Dr H.C. Coombs on 2 October 1968.  He said that Dr Battersby \"would be responsible to the Council for the organisation of studies of various aspects of the Arts and for the formulation for consideration by the Council, of Federal submissions to the Federal Government\".  (Sydney Morning Herald, 2 October 1968 p.2)   Commonwealth grants to the performing arts through the recommendations of the Australian Council for the Arts totalled $1,666,349 in 1968-9; $2,659,244 in 1969-70; $3,793,062 in 1970-1; $4,493,153 in 1971-2; and $5,733,643 in 1972-3. (Reports of the Auditor-General upon the Treasurer's statement of receipts and expenditure 1968-9, 1969-70, 1970-1, 1971-2, 1972-3).   The establishment of a new Council for the Arts was foreshadowed in November 1972 by the then Leader of the Opposition, E.G Whitlam when he announced the policies of the Labour Party for the arts.  He set out four broad objectives, namely to encourage excellence in the arts, to foster a wider spread of interest and participation, to help develop a national identity through artistic expression and to project Australia's image in other countries by means of the arts.  He proposed a statutory council devolving wide responsibilities on Boards for various art forms (Australian Council for the Arts, First Annual Report, January to December, 1973 p 9).   In January 1973 a new Council was established when the new Prime Minister the Rt. Hon. (E) Gough Whitlam announced a major reorganisation of Federal Government involvement in the arts.  He invited twenty-four people to form a new Council \"with a charter to ensure a continuity of support to existing recipients so that past government commitments might be honoured, to prepare a budget for the increased help which the Government had undertaken to provide and to prepare detailed plans for a Statutory Authority broadly based on the proposals outlined in the policy speech\" (Ibid).   In February 1973, the membership of the seven specialist constituent Boards was announced.  \"Approximately one third of the people appointed had been members of bodies advising the previous Government.

The four broad objectives outlined in the Policy Speech were:   a) to encourage excellence in the arts; b) to foster a wider spread of interest and participation; c) to help develop a national identity through artistic expression    Industry/activity class: d) to project Australia's image in other countries by means of the    arts.   The speech also proposed a statutory Council involving wide responsibilities on Boards for various art forms.   Once the Labor Government came into power, moves were made to give effect to the above proposals and in January 1973 the Prime Minister the Rt. Hon. Gough Whitlam invited twenty-four people to form a new Council with a charter to ensure a continuity of support to existing recipients so that past government commitments might be honoured, to prepare a budget for the increased help which the government had undertaken to provide and to prepare detailed plans for a statutory authority broadly based on the proposals outlined in the Policy Speech.   The membership of the Council included four categories of people. The majority were prominent artists and persons closely involved in the arts including the Chairmen of the various Boards. They were supported by others with legal, financial and other administrative skills, with however, a known interest in the arts, and by several senior officials of government departments and agencies whose work interlocked with that of the council.   The council met for the first time on 16 February 1973 and rapidly assembled a draft report which was tabled in Parliament by the Prime Minister on 24 May 1973 on the shape and working arrangements for a continuing authority in the arts.  After considerable debate on the issues raised in the above report a final version was sent to the Prime Minister and approved by Cabinet in November 1973.   The Australia Council, the establishment of which was recommended by the above reports, was established on 13 March 1975 by the Australia Council Act 1975.

The School was set up as the national training facility for film and television professionals.  The functions of the School, as outlined in the Act, were to: provide education and training; conduct and encourage research; conduct seminars and other such courses for professionals; co-operate with other television bodies with respect to program production; offer facilities to professionals for the purposes of program production; make grants of financial assistance; and award degrees, diplomas, and certificates in relation to the educational courses offered by the school. The Act further stated that the \"School shall exercise its functions with a view to enabling and encouraging the production of films and television programs of a high degree of creativeness and of high technical and artistic standards\". (2)  Under the Act the School was to be governed by a body to be known as the Council of the Film and Television School. The Council consisted of the Director of the School, two members of the staff of the School elected by the staff, two students of the School elected by the student body, and five members appointed by the Governor-General. (3)  The first Council of the School consisted of:  Chairman: Barry Jones, MLA Members: J. Bailey          H. Crawford          J. Flaus          G. Healy          J. Long (Deputy Chairman)          R.K. Mason          J.H.M. Oswin          B. Robinson          P. Weir  The first Director of the School was Professor Jerzy Toeplitz, formerly of Poland's National Film School and the first Assistant Director was John Martin-Jones.  The School offered its first courses in 1973. Two courses were offered: the full-time program for full time students, usually not experienced in the industry, and the open program for professionals in the film and television area. The School also administered, from its first year of operation, various grants-in-aid to enable suitably qualified people to benefit from study, experience, or training in Australia or overseas. (5)  The School began its operations at 2 Help Street, Chatswood, the former offices of the Interim Council of the School. Land was acquired at North Ryde and by April 1975 the School was able to move from Chatswood and hold its courses at North Ryde.  On 29 October 1976 the Film and Television Act was amended by the insertion of the word 'Australian' before 'Film', and by the addition to the School's functions of responsibility for training and education in the areas of radio broadcasting and audio-visual communications.

Under Section 21 part 1 the Corporation has power:   (a) to make loans on such terms and conditions, including conditions     as to repayments of principal and payment of interest, as the     Corporation thinks fit, to producers of Australian films;    (b) to guarantee -       (i) the due repayment of loans made to producers of Australian           films; and      (ii) the due payment of interest on such loans.   (c) to provide financial assistance to producers of Australian films     under arrangements that entitle the Corporation to receive a     share of the proceeds derived from the sale, hire or exhibition     of the films or, the inclusion of the films in television     programmes but do not render the Corporation liable for any debts     incurred by those producers; and   (d) subject to the approval of the Minister, to form, or participate     with another person in the formation of a company for the purpose     of carrying on business, of the distribution of Australian films     and to acquire, hold and dispose of shares or stock in the     capital of a company carrying on such a business.   By Section 18 one million dollars was appropriated for the Corporation.   Under Section 6 the Corporation was to consist of a Chairman and four other members appointed by the Governor-General, and under Section 22 there was also to be an Executive Officer to manage the affairs of the Corporation.   This Act was assented to on 17 June 1970 and the Corporation was established by Proclamation on 17 August 1970 (Commonwealth Gazette, 17 August 1970, p 5687).   The Board of the Corporation, announced by the Prime Minister the Rt Hon John Gorton on 17 August 1970 was:  Chairman J Darling, and members D E Brown, MBE, T S Duckmanton, CBE, R S Elliott and Barry Jones. (The Australian, 18 August 1970, p 2).   By April 1974 the Corporation was providing money to the Australian film industry at an average of $130,000 per month and had been involved in the production of both feature films and films for television.  The feature films include \"Alvin Purple\", \"The Adventures of Barry McKenzie\", \"The Cars That Ate Paris\", \"Petersen\", and \"Between Wars\".   The Corporation had also helped finance the T.V documentaries 'Wild Country'- Channel 7 and 'Poisoned Dart'- Channel 10, and has provided assistance for television series including 'Ryan', 'Homicide', 'Boney', 'Silent Number', and 'Seven Little Australians'. (Department of the Media, A Review of Activities, April 1974, pp 43-47).   In a press statement on 10 December 1973, the Minister for the Media, Senator the Hon Douglas McClelland, in announcing the proposed legislation to establish an Australian Film Commission stated that the Commission would replace the Australian Film Development Corporation which would be disbanded.  (Sydney Morning Herald, 13 February 1974, p 22).   On 28 September 1974 the Australian Film Commission Bill 1974 was presented to Parliament but was rejected by the Senate on 3 December 1974. The Australian Film Commission Act was finally assented to on 7 March 1975.   However, under the terms of the Act, the Australian Film Development Corporation Act 1970 and the Australian Film Development Corporation Act (No 2) 1970, continued to be extant, as Part VI of the Act covering the repeal of these acts had to be proclaimed separately. Part VI was proclaimed on 8 July 1975 and from that date \"all rights property and assets (including the moneys standing to the credit of the Australian Film Development Fund) that immediately before [..date of proclamation..] were vested in the Australian Film Development Corporation, [were] ... vested in the Commission\".

Cabinet agreed that an independent statutory body as recommended by the Tariff Board be established, but that the structure and membership should be a matter for further consideration between the Minister for the Media, The Treasurer and The Public Service Board. It authorised Senator McClelland to proceed with the establishment of an interim board of the Australian Film Commission so work may be commenced in the planning stages. (The Media, A collection of speeches made by the Minister for the Media, Senator The Honourable Douglas McClelland during the period 16 June - 10 December 1973, Appendix 2).  On 12 February 1974 Senator McClelland announced the membership of The Interim Board of the Film Commission stating that the Board \"is expected to operate for about six months before the Commission's permanent board is approved by Parliament\" (Sydney Morning Herald 13 February 1974 p. 22). Members were Messrs. J. Darling (Chairman), R. Elliott, L. Beioley, G. Burke, H. Crawford, J. McQuaid, J. Oswin, S. Walton, R. Whitbread, Sir Keith Waller and Joan Long. The first meeting was held on 27 February 1974, and the Broadcasting and Film Division of the Department of the Media was given the responsibility of preparing more than 50 briefing papers for the Interim Board to assist its consideration of matters associated with the establishment and operation of the Australian Film Commission (Department of the Media, Report for 1 July 1973 - 30 June 1974 p. 8).  On 26 September 1974 the Australian Film Commission Bill 1974 was presented to Parliament but was rejected by the Senate on 3 December, 1974. The Bill was presented again in early 1975 and was assented to on 7 March 1975. The Interim Board continued to function until 5 May 1975 when the full-time Board of the Australian Film Commission was appointed.

The functions of the Commission are to encourage and finance \"the making, promotion, distribution and exhibition of Australian Films\". It was also given powers to make, promote and exhibit film on behalf of Departments of State and in the national interest of Australia. The Act also gave the Commission the powers previously exercised by the Australian Film Development Corporation (CA 1666), although these functions were not taken over until 8 July 1975 when Part VI of the Australian Film Commission which repealed the Australian Film Development Corporation Act was proclaimed. In April 1975 considerable controversy in the Australian film industry surrounded a letter written by the then Minister for the Media Senator Douglas McClelland inviting Mr Jack Valenti, President of the Motion Picture Association of America to suggest names of people suitable for the board of the newly-formed Commission. Following the nature of this letter becoming public knowledge the Minister compiled a list of Australian nominees recommended for appointment to the Film Commission (Sydney Morning Herald 14 April 1975 p. 3) On 15 April 1975 Senator McClelland announced the membership of the Commission. Initial appointments to the Commission consisted of four full-time and four part-time members whose appointments dated from 5 May 1975: Full-time Members: Mr K.

Walter Moffit Marks MP was appointed Chairman of the Commission and the Commissioners were Senator Walter Leslie Duncan, Senator John Grant, Senator the Hon Herbert Hays, Francis Michael Forde MP, the Hon Henry Gregory MP and Lewis Windemere Nott MP. Mr A A Tregear was Secretary of the Commission and Mr T C Pittaway was Assistant Secretary.   The Commission was to \"inquire into and report on the moving picture industry in Australia and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to inquire particularly into:   1. the importation, production, distribution and exhibition of moving    picture films;   2. the incidence and effect of the customs tariff upon the    importation of such films and the sufficiency or otherwise of    existing duties of customs;   3. the sufficiency or otherwise of the existing income tax law of the    Commonwealth in relation to persons, firms and companies engaged    in the industry; and   4. the connection with any and all of the foregoing matters, the    income, profits, expenditure and losses of such persons, firms and    companies derived from or incurred in connection with the    industry, and the amount of capital invested in the industry.\"   Evidence was taken in all the capital cities of Australia and in certain states where local problems of distribution and exhibition warranted it. 147 sittings were held and 253 witnesses were examined, evidence being taken in camera where necessary.   The four divisions of the motion picture industry were dealt with separately; namely the importation, distribution, exhibition and production of films.   The fifty recommendations of the Commission included:   . that a Board of Film Censors should be established consisting of   two men and a woman;   . that there should also be a Censorship Board of Appeal consisting   of five members, on which the motion picture industry would not be   represented;   . all film distributors in Australia should be registered and   contracts for distribution limited to 12 months;   . all motion picture exhibitors should be registered and the films   screened by them subject to the Commonwealth Censorship Board;    . the Appeal Board should issue Awards for Merit for the   encouragement of film production in Australia;   . a quota system should be introduced ensuring an increasing   percentage of Empire produced feature films, 5 in the first year   increasing to 15 in the third year;   . films shown in Mandated Territories should be passed by the   Censorship Board as suitable for that specific exhibition;   . films should be graded by the Censorship Board as \"suitable for   Universal Exhibition\" and \"For Adults Only\" with those shown at   matinees for children being only of the former type;   . educational films in the States should be assisted in every way by   the Commonwealth;   . taxation of gross earnings remitted to America by Australian Branch   companies should be reconsidered;   . British agencies should be established for the distribution of   their own films; and   . customs tariffs on British films should be continued with   reciprocal tariff preference for Australian films entering Britain   and other parts of the Empire.

The first meeting was held in Sydney on 23 September 1932 and J H Keating appeared as Counsel to assist the Commission and represent the public. Many companies were represented at this meeting and at subsequent meetings further associations, societies and bodies were represented, members of the public supplied information and gave evidence also. There were 67 sittings, 60 witnesses gave evidence and 169 exhibits were produced.   The Australasian Performing Rights Association Ltd which was incorporated on 4 January 1926 had a close association with the Performing Rights Society (Britain) in that this Society had a representative on the Board of Directors of the Australian Association, neither was profit making. In his Report the Commissioner commended the Association for its organisation and methods of distributing moneys to authors, composers, publishers and others. However, the super-monopoly of the Association in controlling over 80% of the best music which was subject to copyright meant that it controlled the music performed in public and dictated its own terms.   The Commissioner recommended that there should be a Tribunal to determine disputes arising out of the performances in public of musical works and for the use of records in public; that the Australasian Performing Rights Association should compile from time to time a list of musical works requiring licence; that there should be regular filing of accounts of the receipts and distribution of fees collected by the Australasian Performing Rights Association probably at the nearest Copyright Office; that no fees should be paid for relay broadcasting provided the initial fee had been paid and no charges made where the performance was not directly for private profit or was for religious, educational or charitable purposes.

The idea of such festival held in Canberra had been mooted as early as 1968 by the Canberra Theatre Trust. A group of people were brought together within the Department of the Capital Territory to make preparations for the Festival planed for March 1975. The Ordinance governing the Activities of Festival Australia was drawn up in the Department of the Capital Territory, and by the Ordinance the Board of Governors was appointed.(1)  A number of committees were also set up by the Ordinance Schedule. They were:   Programme - Arts Committee, Programme - Science Committee, Finance Committee, Public Relations Committee, Community Participation Committee. (2)   The Minister of State for the Department of the Capital Territory was to be the Chairman of the Board of Governors. The City Manager (from the Department of the Capital Territory) was to be Deputy Chairman. The Board members were people of substantial standing in the fields of the arts and science.   The Festival Australia body was incorporated to organise and raise funds for a national festival of the creative arts and sciences. It was empowered 'to promote and encourage Australia arts, science and technology'(3) by organising exhibitions, festival (music, drama, films and so forth), lectures and other performances in the fields of the arts and sciences in suitable venues in Canberra. It was therefore enabled to employ persons, to engage venues and raise funds for the purpose of holding festivals.     In the Constitutions of Festival Australia sixteen objects and powers were outlined. The major objects and powers were described as:   \"(a) to promote and encourage Australian arts, science and technology and for these purpose to organise, promote manage and conduct festivals of music drama and other entertainments and exhibitions, demonstrations, expositions, lectures and other activities in Canberra or elsewhere annually or at such intervals as Festival Australia may determine;   (b) to present, produce, manage and conduct at theatres, halls galleries, cinemas, lecture theatres and other premises and open spaces activities such as operas, plays, dramas, ballets, concerts, recitals, exhibitions, readings, demonstrations, expositions, lectures, cinematographic performances and other entertainments or activities as may tend to promote and encourage Australian arts, science and technology;   (c) to engage, and employ persons and bodies corporate to produce and present such operas, plays, dramas, ballets, concerts, recitals, exhibitions, readings, demonstrations, expositions, lectures, cinematographic performances and other entertainments or activities as may tend to promote and encourage Australian arts, science and technology;   (d) to engage  employ or sponsor persons and bodies corporate to conduct or engage in research or any other activities as may tend to promote and encourage Australian arts, science or technology,   (e) to make and carry out ... arrangements... for the presentation of operas, plays, dramas, ballets, concerts, recitals, exhibitions, reading, demonstrations [etc] as may tend to promote and encourage Australian arts, science or technology..;   (f) to engage in the sale and distribution of admission tickets to entertainment or instruction conducted by or on behalf of Festival Australia;   (h) to establish such courses of study, and award such scholarships, as will enable the objects of Festival Australia to be best attained;   (i) to provide and maintain such libraries and a associated facilities as are necessary or desirable for carrying out the objects of Festival Australia;   (j) to raise money for the purpose of Festival Australia....,   (k) to invest the funds of Festival Australia or under its charge and not immediately required upon such securities or investments as the Board may from time to time determine;   (l) to undertake and execute any trusts the undertaking where or may be incidental to the attainment of the objects of Festival Australia or any of them;   (m) to establish and support and aid in the establishment and support of any associations or institutions which have for their objects the promotions, or encouragement of Australia arts, science or technology on the study of the arts, science or technology   (n) to provide meeting places, clubs and other social amenities in connection with festivals organised or promoted by Festival Australia.   (o) to acquire, hold, purchase, lease, sell, exchange, mortgage and dispose of any form of property real or personal for the purposes of Festival Australia.(4)   The original intention was that such a national festival should be held biennially, but after the first festival, Australia,'75, it was decided that this was not economically feasible.   The original Board consisted of:   Margot Anthony, Arthur Birch, John Bruce, Rupert Cater, Penelope Chapman; Michael Edgley; the Hon. Russell Fox; Lady Heydon; Ross Hohnen; L. Engledow; Arthur Kenyon; Richard Kingsland; Leonie Kramer; David Purnell.   The Secretarial staff was drawn primarily from the Department of the Capital Territory, which also provided office accommodation. The main records created by Festival Australia were the minutes of the Board's and of the Committee's meetings and correspondence, handled by the Secretariat.   By ordinance No. 34 of 1978 the Government dissolved the current Board of Governors which had last been amended by Ordinance No. 14 of 1976. Whilst ordinance No 34 did not dissolve the corporation itself, it virtually suspended the Board's activities by not making any new appointments  In future appointment would be made by instrument in writing by the Minister of State for the Capital Territory and would consist of the following:-   2 officers or employees of the Department of the Capital Territory; 1 officer or employee of the Department of the Prime Minister and      Cabinet; 1 officer or employee of the Department of Finance; 1 member of the Legislative Assembly; The Minister of State for the Capital Territory   The ordinance also stated that the rights, privileges, obligations and liabilities of the Corporation immediately before 26 October 1978 should be rested in the Commonwealth, and that the Commonwealth should also be substituted for the Corporation in any legal proceedings.(5)   As this ordinance only suspended the activities of the Board and did not abolish the organisation itself, the closing date of the date range of this agency had been taken as 1979, the year in which Festival Australia Inc. is no longer listed in the Commonwealth Directory as an organisation for which the Minister for the Capital Territory is responsible.   This information was drawn primarily from the Australian Government Directory. 1974 and  1979; from the Festival Australia Incorporation Ordinance 1973, from the records created by Festival Australia; and from Mr W.E Lawrence, present member of the Board of Governors.

(2) Under Section 4(2) of the Ordinance the Trust was established as a body corporate, with a common seal, the ability to acquire, hold and dispose of real and personal property and the ability to sue or be sued in its corporate name. Under Section 4(3) of the ordinance all courts, judges and persons acting judicially were required to take judicial notice of the common seal of the trust affixed to a document and to assume that it was duly affixed. Under Section 17 of the Ordinance, the functions of the Trust were stated as being: a) to occupy the Canberra Theatre Centre, and to use and manage it as a concert hall, theatre and place of assembly for the presentation of artistic and cultural entertainments displays and exhibitions and other forms of entertainment and instruction; b) to promote and encourage the development and presentation of the arts; c) to promote and encourage public interest and participation in, and appreciation of, the arts; c) to the extent that the Canberra Theatre Centre is not required for the purposes of the performance of the foregoing functions, to make it available for public and other meetings, and for conventions, receptions and other gatherings. Under Section 18(1) of the Ordinance the Trust was empowered to do all things necessary or convenient to be done in connection with, or as incidental to, the performance of its functions. Section 18 (2a-2f) details particular powers of the Trust in relation to contracts, purchase, granting of rights to use the Theatre, admission charges, recording and broadcasting and provision of public facilities (restaurant etc). Under Section 30 of the Ordinance, the Trust was required to furnish the Minister such information relating to its operations as the Minister from time to time requires. Under Section 32 (1) of the Ordinance, the trust was required, as soon as practicable after each thirteenth day of June, to furnish to the Minister a report of its operations during the year ended on that date, together with financial statements, in such form as the Minister of State for finance approves, in respect of that year. Under Section 6 and Section 7 of the Ordinance the Trust was to be constituted by a Chairman, a Deputy Chairman and seven other trustees. All trustees were to be appointed by the Minister for the Interior [II] (and later for the Capital Territory). Six trustees constituted a quorum, voting being decided by a majority of votes. The first trustees were: Leslie Bruce Hamilton, Stefan Haag, John Casson, Ian Maclean, Hector William Crawford, Clement William Semmler, Arthur Thomas Shakespeare, George Alexander Currie and Richard Kingsland. These were appointed for a period of one year, however, Section 6(2) of the Ordinance states that the Minister may appoint trustees for a period not exceeding five years. Under Section 22 of the Ordinance the Trust may employ such persons as it thinks necessary, the terms and conditions (including remuneration) of such employment to be determined by the Trust, subject to any directions of the Minister.

Therefore on 3 September 1976 the Australian Art Exhibitions Corporation (AAEC) Limited was established as a company owned by the Australia Council. The AAEC, together with another organisation, the Australian GalleryDirector's Council, successfully managed several exhibitions including the El Dorado-Colombian Gold Exhibition (in 1978) and the Pompeii Exhibition (in 1980). Both agencies however, experienced financial difficulties and ultimately went into liquidation. In 1979 the Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon R.J. Ellicott, initiated the first moves towards establishing a Commonwealth organisation which would specialise in international exhibitions. On 16 May 1980 the first board of Directors of the International Cultural Corporation of Australia (ICCA) was appointed and held the inaugural meeting. The agency however, was formally incorporated on 24 June 1980. It was a Commonwealth-owned company registered in the Australian Capital Territory. The major aim of the Corporation is to bring to Australia significant international exhibitions and displays of art, antiquities and other items of artistic, cultural and historical interest. It also aims to send overseas the best of Australian art, antiquities and related items. The Corporation is entrepreneurial in its methods of operation and seeks sponsorship from the private sector. It offers its expertise and assistance to the Federal and State Governments and to museums and galleries. For the first four years of operation ICCA received a grant of $250,000 from the Australian Government. The agency's title changed to Art Exhibitions Australia Limited in March 1991. The charter of the company is to manage exhibitions and displays of art, antiquities and other cultural or historical material. The company functions as a self-funding, non-profit body governed by a Board of Directors who serve in an honorary capacity. The initial Chairman of the company was Mr James Leslie, Chairman and Managing Director of Mobil Oil Australia Ltd and the Board comprised as follows: Mr Norman Baker, Arthur Young and Co (Deputy Chairman) Dr Jean Battersby, CEO, Australia Council Mr Franco Belgiorno-Nettis, Managing Director, Transfield Group Mr Edmund Capon, Director, Art Gallery of NSW Ms Betty Churcher, Director, Australian National Gallery Mr Michael Darling, Managing Director, Clayton Robard Ltd Mr Robert Edwards, Director, Museum of Victoria (Chief Executive) Mrs Ann Lewis, Co-publisher of Xpress magazine Hon. Mr Justice John Lockhart, Judge of the Federal Court Mr Alan McGregor, grazier Mr Robert S. McKay Since its inception the following exhibitions have been arranged and managed by the Corporation: Aboriginal Art, Australian Pictorial Photography, Chinese Paintings of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, Fabulous Fashions 1907-1967, Australian Exhibition, Modern Commonwealth, Australian Heritage, Chinese Landscape Photography, Japan - Masterpieces from the Idemitsu Collection, Kandinsky Exhibition, Leonardo da Vinci Anatomical Drawings, Commonwealth Arts Festival; and Xian Exhibition, Terracotta Figures, China Records created by the Corporation include correspondence, financial documentation, newspaper clippings, catalogues, videocassettes and photographs. Exhibitions managed by ICCA (up to March 1991) were indemnified by the Commonwealth. The succeeding company, Art Exhibitions Australia Limited, was entered on the Register of Cultural Organisations established under Section 78(1)(a) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, listing bodies eligible to receive tax deductible donations. The company maintains close links with the Commonwealth arts portfolio and continues to receive indemnity on exhibitions.

According to press coverage and advertisements in July 1983, the Corporation was setting up a Secretariat group in Sydney in line with recommendations of the Dix Committee. The Secretariat was to research and develop policy options for the Board. The Corporation's functions include the provision of innovative and comprehensive broadcasting and television services of a high standard that involve broadcasting and television programs of an educational nature and that contribute to a sense of national identity, inform and entertain, and reflect the cultural diversity of the Australian Community. The Corporation's functions also include the transmission to countries outside Australia, of broadcasting and television programs of news, current affairs, entertainment and cultural enrichment; and the encouragement and promotion of the musical, dramatic and other performing arts in Australia. As part of its administration of these functions the ABC has an extensive network of television and radio broadcasting stations throughout Australia.

Items from Artbank's collection are available on lease for display in Commonwealth Government offices and other agencies in Australia and overseas. Clients are encouraged to place these works wherever large numbers of people meet, eg reception areas, foyers, etc. In this way they are enabling more Australians to become familiar with the works of their contemporaries.

This Act changed the functions of the School, as originally established, by giving it responsibility for training in the areas of radio broadcasting and audio-visual communications. The name of the School was changed to Australian Film, Television and Radio School by the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, to properly reflect the functions of the school.  It retained its previous functions of education and training in film and television for both students and professionals, and the administration of financial grants. (1)  As part of the change in function the School established a Radio Unit which, in 1979, began by providing services and training to Aboriginal broadcasters. In 1981 the School installed a broadcast standard studio and began training for all sectors of radio broadcasting. At this time it also began a course in commercial radio techniques. (2)  Professor Jerzy Toeplitz who had been appointed director of the original Film and Television School (CA 1617) was replaced in 1980 by A.S. Walton. (3)  In 1985 (9 May) Walton was replaced by Ms Anne Deveson. (4)  The new Director instituted an examination of the School's activities which resulted in a report entitled \"New Directions Review\".  This review found gaps in the School's performance and recommended that the School: place greater emphasis on television training; increase training for aboriginals in the film, video, and television areas; increase the involvement of the School with industry; increase training in entrepreneurial skills; monitor technological developments in the industry; and introduced a new program to enable professionals to experiment. The main aim of the change in direction was to make the School more relevant to the professional needs of the industry and to reduce costs by increasing cooperation with other organisations. (5) The Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1986 changed the name of the School to the Australian Film, Television and Radio School.  In June 1986 work commenced on the School's first permanent home, a site within the grounds of Macquarie University, North Ryde.   Executive Minute No. 12 of 27 December 1991 approved changes to the administrative arrangements whereby the agency was placed from that date under the responsibility of the Minister for the newly created Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (CA 7431) (Commonwealth of Australia Gazette No. S 370 Friday, 27 December 1991).

From 23 October 1990 to 1 January 1992, the Institute was funded jointly by the Commonwealth and Australian Capital Territory  Government's.   In July 1989, an affiliation agreement was made between the Institute and the Australian National University (ANU).  As a result of this, discussions took place on the feasibility of amalgamation from the beginning of 1991.   The new arrangement was designed to achieve autonomy for the Institute, while giving students academic and administrative benefits by being aligned to a larger institution.  It would also preserve the relationship between the Institute and the Canberra community.   The amending legislation for the amalgamation was not ready by 1 January 1991.  Instead, amendments to the existing Australian National University Act were assented to by Parliament on 2 September 1991 and confirmed the establishment of an institute previously known as the Canberra Institute of the Arts within the University to take effect from 1 January 1992.    The Institute would be known as the Institute of the Arts and included the Canberra School of Music and the Canberra School of Art.   The amended Australian National University Act 1991, No. 131 of 1991, also repealed the Canberra Institute of the Arts Ordinance 1988.   The internal structure of the newly established Institute of the Arts remained as before except that it was now governed by a Board responsible to the Council of the University.   The University was given the power to employ staff, enrol students and grant a degree, diploma or certificate of the Institute of the Arts. The assets and liabilities of the Institute also became those of the University.

A National Broadcasting Symphony Orchestra participated in the opening night ABC program on July 1, 1932.  There was early intention by ABC management to set up a symphony orchestra in each State.  First use of the name Melbourne Symphony Orchestra was in 1906, this orchestra was founded by Alberto Zelman, junior.  During the period 1932 - 36 orchestras performing for an ABC concert were announced as, \"appearing under the auspices of\", \"in association with\", or by courtesy of\" the University of Melbourne.  This was in recognition of the fact that the University 'owned' the name but was prepared to allow the ABC to take over administrative control of the orchestra and use the name ABC (Melbourne) Symphony Orchestra.  The first year of a permanent ABC orchestra in Victoria was 1949.  This orchestra was called the Victorian Symphony Orchestra at the insistence of the Victorian Government.    It was not until 1965 when the name reverted to Melbourne Symphony Orchestra under the then Premier Sir Henry Bolte.  By 1957 the last of the State Symphony Orchestras had been set up.  Development of the ABC's six symphony orchestras has taken 25 years from the modest beginnings [1932].  The ABC was by then possibly the largest single comprehensive concert giving organisation in the world.

During 1972 it was decided that it would be known in future as the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra (TSO) on all occasions.  The TSO is the smallest of the six ABC orchestras.  It entrepreneurs its own subscription series of concerts in Hobart and Launceston, tours Tasmanian regional centres, plays for visiting ballet companies, performs free outdoor concerts, has a comprehensive education program, and has received wide exposure via recordings, national broadcasts and television appearances.  The ABC is responsible for the management and control of the orchestra and also provides funding for a bulk of the operational costs with further funding provided from the Tasmanian Government, local councils and corporate sponsorship.  In 1985 the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Concert Music Department was formed incorporating the TSO.  As a result the TSO was given greater autonomy of management to be more responsible to local needs.

It was established in July 1988 as a wholly owned government company.  The FFC's responsibilities are set out in a contract with the Commonwealth of Australia and its powers and functions are determined by its Memorandum of Association. The FFC receives an annual appropriation from the Federal Government, supplemented by earnings from investments made in previous years.  The FFC invests in feature films, telemovies, mini-series and documentaries provided there is support from private sector investors including marketplace participants such as broadcasters, distributors and sales agents. To qualify for investment, productions need to be certified as 'qualifying Australian films' as defined by Division 10BA of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Provisional certificates are provided by the Department of Communications and the Arts. In addition to investments the FFC may provide production loans and print and advertising loans aimed at facilitating the theatrical release of feature films.  All production investment decisions are made by the FFC Board which meets monthly. The FFC Chief Executive has limited delegated powers to vary Board investment decisions. The FFC has offices in Sydney, which is the Corporation's administration centre, and in Melbourne.
